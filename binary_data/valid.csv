 Hi, Pompous Ass!  ;) 

I know you think you're some kind of poker authority on Wikipedia, and that it's somehow your perogative to give the Imperial final thumbs up or thumbs down on what's acceptable regarding anything to do with poker here, but guess what? That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a """"big man"""", and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.

The edits I have made (and will continue to make) on the Jack Straus entry regarding his death doesn't violate policy in ANY way. If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used. You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything poker-related on Wikipedia. You are not, and you will not censor me. And as I'm sure you've already realized, my ISP address constantly changes, so you won’t be able to block me, either.

Notability of Buffalo Zero
A tag has been placed on Buffalo Zero requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  69.123.113.89  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since there isn't much to this article (or stub), I thought I would add some of my own personal experience with phenibut. I use it occasionally for insomnia. In my opinion, it is not a long term solution for insomnia. Tolerance develops for me within three days of consecutive use. I have never had a problem with withdrawal, but I have heard that is possible, but not life threatening, just uncomfortable.

Phenibut does has a long half-life so usage should be spaced out. I would recommend a maximum of one day usage according to label instructions, then a minimum of two days off. One use a week would be preferable.

It does work well for insomnia, and tends to produce vivid dreams, which is interesting, but its usage should be carefully monitored.

When used as directed, I have heard of no major side effects. It will increase the potency of sedatives, so that must be kept in mind.

 Edit war brewing at Yosemite National Park

I was also approached recently with regards to possible edits to the Yosemite National Park article. My input on the matter can be found at the following link;
user talk:Edit Centric#Hantavirus Risk in Yosemite

Noted,   

 Thmc1 / 173.63.176.93 sill sockpuppeting / REPLYU REQUSTED 

This person (blocked sockmaster Thmc1) is still block evading by not logging in, even after he was warned by SysAdmin Kudpung. I would suggest that you block the suspected IPs(173.63176.93, 74.88.160.244) as well as IPs used by his other blocked account (Nyc88) and any other accounts affiliated w/them. Why are sockppuppets of a blocked sockmaster still allowed to edit even after ample warnings? To make matters worse, he even violated his block and continuted editing the day after he was blocked! Please see Thmc1 sockpuppet investigation archive for latest investigation/evidence.   

No clue  links would be helpful.   

Actually I think it's the other way around, if I'm not mistaken, I think I remember   being mentioned to admin Ronhjones as a possible sockpuppet in the past few months in conjunction with an edit disagreement issue. Are you stocking this address? Is this some sort of retaliation? First of all, I have no idea who any of these other users are, much less others who use this IP address. 173.63.176.93  
Hmm... Thanks, I think, hadn't noticed the 173... above was the same as the 173... I just talked to .. still no clue why MBaxter showed up here. Aw well - keep on keepin' on   

Vsmith- Don't let 173.63.176.93 fool you. It was him who attempted to mention this to RonHJones using IP 74.88.160.244. That IP was found to be one of 173.63.176.93's sockpuppet and blocked after a recent investigation. 173.63.176.93 is actually a sockpuppet of Thmc1, blocked for excessive sockpuppeting back in 2010. Even though 173.63.176.93 was ruled most likley as one of Thmc1's sockpuppet, he was let off with a warning. For the full story, I suggest that you check out Thmc1's most recent investigation, August 2012. The final assessment was one account (Nyc88) permanently blocked, one IP temporarily blocked, and one left open with warning. If he causes you anymore trouble, you should report this to the SysAdmins and don't hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation. The reverting of your edits is the same kind of BS he conducted on the London City article that got him blocked back in 2010. He has an anti-UK bias amongst many, and you can confirm this with user Eraserhead1.   —Preceding undated comment added

I see you have updated the security system. Nice. Is it a McAfee 2000?. Just dropped by to relate a little story I uncovered as I wandered here and there...
There once was a little boy named Johnny who had a wonderful dog named Laddie.  Johnny was prone to emotional outbursts, and his mother was concerned by his overreactions. One day while Johnny was at school, Laddie was killed in an unfortunate accident. The mother took Laddie's body and put it in the backyard. She was very worried how Johnny would react to the news of his dog's death. When Johnny returned from school, his mother said to him, """"I'm really sorry, Johnny, but Laddie died in an accident."""" Johnny responded """"Okay"""" and went upstairs to change his clothers. The mother was quite surprised at the calm reaction. After Johnny put on his play clothes, he went out to the backyard. All of a sudden, the mother heard Johnny screaming. She rushed out to the backyard and saw Johnny prostrate over the dog's body and wailing. The mother said, """"But, Johnny, I told you Laddie died."""" In between sobs, Johnny sputtered, """"I thought you said Daddy.""""

GO FUCK YOURSELF DUMB CUNT, now that is grossly incivil when said towards a person, which I haven't yet, so don't block me (because I know you will). Occasionally putting the worlds most versitial word 'fuck' in a sentence isn't incivil it's just stressing a point. About Eddieebo's death threat to someone, I read that, you are one dumb cunt, seriously, you are fucking stupid. That was not a death threat, there are death threats and death threats, this is the former, where it says kill but everyone should know no-one is serious about it. Maybe wikipedia should wake up to themselves, unblock Eddieebo's account, he has made some useful contributions, sure he swears a lot while talking, but thats because people like you shit him up the wall to no end. Left-wing hippies who are all about the people except when that person is right of Ghengis Khan, like Eddieebo.

You do know those are the actions of people who know they are wrong but can't admit it, hey I reckon eddieebo and i can admit where we are wrong, unfortunately you can't, so you abuse justice.

Fanboy is a term used to describe an individual (usually male; the feminine version fangirl may be used for females) who is utterly devoted to a single fannish subject, or to a single point of view within that subject, often to the point where it is considered an obsession. Fanboys remain loyal to their particular obsession, disregarding any factors (often including logic) that differ from their point of view. 

 Background 
Stereotypical fanboys are attributed with a sycophantic devotion to the creators and principles behind a work with which they are currently enthralled. Fanboys are noted for a very emotional attachment to their chosen subject, often taking negative remarks about it as a personal attack. They will readily engage in debates, but will fall back on emotional responses when challenged on facts. For example, a fanboy may go out of his way to point out negative and often untrue statements about their obsession's rivals. Fanboys are often hostile towards critical review of their chosen subject. The stereotypical image of the fanboy is as an unkempt, socially awkward young man who may be perceived as a loud mouthed pseudo-intellectual. Fanboys  are also typically aggressive and hateful towards the opposing brand or competition of their obsession regardless of its merits or achievements. 

As electronic entertainment gained popularity, the term became increasingly applied to video game and television addicts. As a result, a subculture emerged which readily labeled itself as """"fanboys."""" Within this group, more effort is taken to fit in with a perceived standard, resulting in a more outgoing attitude, even among those with insecurities. This outgoing stance is often felt to be abrasive by those not involved in the culture as deeply. The term originated in comic book circles, to describe someone who immersed himself in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom.  The term is often used in a derogatory manner by other less obsessed fans. The term is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex.

The term fangirl, while similar, often carries slightly different connotations. The term fangirl is often applied to any enthusiastic female fan, regardless of obsessive qualities or not, and is often used with overtones of """"teenybopper"""".

History of fanboys and the term
The term """"fanboy"""" is most commonly associated with adolescent and teen males but can be applicable to any age or sex. It is often used in a derogatory manner by other, less obsessed fans. The term originated in comic book circles to describe someone immersed in the fictional worlds of comics and the culture of comics fandom. Common subjects of reverence by fanboys are specific: TV shows; movies; music; anime; comic books; cars; video game consoles, video games and MMORPGs; and computer operating systems, hardware and software.
 
Popular depictions of Fanboy stereotypes include the Comic Book Guy on The Simpsons and columnist Larry Groznic from the satirical newspaper The Onion.  In the songs of the fannish parody musician Luke Ski, many characters proudly consider themselves fanboys.

The earliest published uses of the word """"fanboy"""" have been dated to 1982.  One reference is to the cover of the """"Official Underground and Newave Comix Price Guide"""".  On this cover page are sketched overweight, overzealous comic book collectors wearing T-shirts that state """"Fanboys of America,"""" who are describing the extreme measures they would go to, including moving to San Francisco, to preserve their comics.

Also published in 1982, a comic strip appeared in Jim Engel and Chuck Fiala's """"Fandom Confidential"""" comic.  In the strip, Jim and Chuck met comic artist/writer John Byrne and collapsed into """"mindless paroxysms of adoration.""""  The John Byrne character responded that they were """"a couple of fanboys in bondage"""" (a play on words referring to a Monty Python sketch in which an Elizabethan era character reads what she claims to be a new Shakespeare work called """"Gay Boys in Bondage"""". http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1;=Miscellaneous+Questions#154 Another early use is in a smart-alec editorial reply by """"Ambush Bug"""" to a letter in his comic in 1985.

This is not an accident 

Some of the sections/articles on Kambojas, as being edited and altered by Debachmann, are getting utterly confusing and more messier, and, I'm afraid, may lead to erroneous conclusions by the readers. As he has started editing/altering them en mass, either he should improve the articles by editing them suitably so as to keep them clear, logical and readable and at the same time, also maintain/keep intact their integrity and factuality (let's us if he can do it), or else, I will have no alternative except to revert them back to their original versions. For example, the article Language and ethnicity of Kambojas, in its current form which he has edited, is utterly terrible. I don't think he and other editors on kamboj articles of his kind are quite familiar with the Kamboj history, so as to render them a justice. Further, please make a note that, none of the information, in any of articles on the Kambojas, is a original-research as Mr Debachmann continues to allege. All the Kamboj information is in the books and only he and other people of his ilk may not be aware of it. I have sent this note to him not with any intention to enter into a futile argument with him, but simply to let him know that all the information on the Kambojas..ancient/mediaval or modern, as inserted in any Kamboj related article here, is well-documented and has been taken from reliable references/sources from notable scholars.

I'm not sure if the reference to open source as an example of innovation outside the 'traditional' IP model is as strong as it could be. As far as I can see, the 'standard' argument for IP protection is not that it's the only way that people can innovate, but that the overall level of innovation will be much higher with it. 

The fact that 'works of authorship can be written without direct financial incentives' does not in itself contradict the standard IP model. For such criticism to be very strong, you would have to show not only that 'direct financial incentives' are not always required, but also that 'direct financial incentives' do not act as a meaningful incentive to innovate in significant cases.

In other words, the standard IP model does not say that counterexamples cannot exist. It just says that you will get more overall innovation with IP protection that you would without it. Listing counterexamples, without also discussing their wider significance, does not in itself invalidate the 'incentives to innovate' argument. It would perhaps be better to cite studies of the effects of patent reform or something like that.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Notability of Your New Heart
 A tag has been placed on Your New Heart requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.    20:03, 18""",0,0,0,0,0,0

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

 Olympic 

Formation and early years
The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games. It's referenced by Phythian, p. 7?
Yes, that's right    
Decline and colapse
In 1886 the club's committee was forced to reduce the players' wages to a quarter of what was being offered by Preston North End. Why it is comparing with the PNE? It's because some players went to play there?
Simply because PNE were the top club in the area.  It shows how much worse Olympic's wages were compared to the top club in the area.  Hope that makes sense    
Rivalries
The rivalry became especially fierce in September 1884, when, amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to """"poach"""" each others' star players, the Rovers' secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against Olympic in the 1884–85 season.

populism as a positive term, and a critique of critics

Since I wrote last fall, several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred. The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion, building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18, """"Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance"""" (http://www.wolpetrust.org.za/dialogue2007/mangcupaper.pdf ). In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of """"populism"""" that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of """"Enlightenment rationalism"""" and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079

As far as Mike Huckabee's """"populism"""" is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (""""Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee"""") has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

I'd like to clarify my concerns with the current version of the article, following the reversion of some of my edits by Stirling Newberry.

My general concern is that it doesn't accurately describe the debate about various causes of hyperinflation.  The article seems to me to be describing a stereotyped view of each side of the debate, which exagerrates the amount of controversy and obscures the amount of common ground.  """"Monetary"""" and """"Crisis of confidence"""" explanations of hyperinflation are describes as if they are two completely different competing theories,  held by different schools of thought (""""monetarists"""" and """"neo-liberals"""").

I think that the overwhelming majority of economists would see both monetary and confidence factors as being important as the initial 'root cause' of hyperinflation, with the importance varying from case to case.  A lot of the economics is very uncontroversial. For example:
It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position.
It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.

I would be interested to hear from Stirling what specific inaccuracies were in my edits, and why he deleted the statement """"The two models are closely related, and often economists may explain hyperinflation as being due to a combination of both effects.""""

 Science items for consideration 

I removed the following:

 On page 7-10 of Volume 1 of """"The Feynmann Lectures on Physics"""" is a marginal figure that illustrates the strength ratio of gravitation attraction and electrical repulsion between two electrons as 1/4.17 x 10^42. The denominator is also written out by hand as a long, snaking 4,170,... followed by 39 more zeros. Feymann mentions the unified field theory, the similarity of the inverse square laws, the disparity of the relative strengths, and asks """"Where could such a large number come from? ... it involves something deep in nature.""""

Re-considering 1st paragraph edit?
I don't understand the reasons for 's recent edit of this article  not that I'm sure that the data are necessarily """"wrong.""""  Rather, I'm persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject.  I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly """"enhanced;"""" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand

 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

At a minimum, I'm questioning this edit?  It deserves to be reconsidered.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Deletion of a lot of Content at Colligo_Contributor 

Hi Tnxman307,

I wanted to ask about the deletion of a ton of content at the Colligo contributor page. I think you labelled this as spam and removed the majority of content on the page then suspended my account """"colligo"""". That's why I'm now posting under my IP address.

A couple of quick things. Yes, I am the CEO of colligo and did an update to the article. I did it openly under the colligo ID which is used rarely to make changes to the article. Occasionally we will make minor changes to correct misinformation (as you can see in the change I made). It is the duty of the company to police misinformation on wikipedia and elsewhere, but I assure you we are not spammers, nor do we intend to provide misinformation or post """"advertisements"""" on Wikipedia. We respect the spirit of posting from a neutral point of view.

The page was actually started in 2007 and went through quite a bit of back and forth before it was finally accepted. Actually, the sections you deleted were accepted in 2007 after much debate. As far as I can tell, the changes made over the last few years were merely additions to the same type of information originally accepted (features and capabilities of the product, press articles etc.). There was very littl hyperbole (if any) in the posting.

Originally the debate centred around whether the page was actually """"neutral"""" and """"notable"""". Some reviewers argued for it and some against. There were some concerns raised that some of the original content was contributed by the company itself. In the end the page was kept (as you can see) as the consensus was that, although the company had contributed, the material was factually accurate and presented from a neutral point of view, so that was OK.

I can provide many examples of pages that are structured similarly. In fact, the model page that was used for the article was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Groove. The sections in this article are very similar to the ones posted on the Colligo Contributor article (which are now deleted).

Tnxman307, I'd like to appeal to you to put the material back up on the page and reinstate my account. As you can see, I don't post often and rarely make changes to the Contributor page. I understand that you and your colleagues at wikipedia are trying to keep it as a neutral and authoritative source of unbiased information. I applaud this! I am hoping that upon review, you will see that the changes made to the article were not biased or """"spammy"""", simply statements of fact.

Thank you,

Barry  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 76.77.70.92   

Also, in considering my account for deletion, please note that I posted elsewhere, including creating the page on Black Hen Music, a music label with which I have no affliation.

Thanks for your consideration.

Barry

Just wondering if you saw this. I know you are busy, so don't mean to bug you. Thanks.
76.77.70.92  

I've been really polite and you've answered several other questions since I've posted this. Maybe I don't understand the protocol, maybe you are the wrong person to talk to, or maybe it's something else. If you could please answer me, I would very much appreciate it. Thanks. 76.77.70.92  
First of all, let me apologize to you for not getting back to you sooner. I got back from vacation right around the time you posted your question and I've missed your last messages. I reviewed the Colligo article and the material that was removed. The material I removed was not supported by reliable sources. All of the material in Wikipedia must be sourced to independent third-party (not a primary source) coverage. While the material was written neutrally, it appeared to be original research. I hope this starts to answer your questions. Please feel free to ask any other questions you may have (and smack me with a trout if I don't answer!). XMan

I understand what you are saying, but if you read what i wrote, you will see that obviously her sales began decreasing even before there was a major impact from piracy and at that time many other artists were outselling her 100k sales, and this is a fact you can search yourself, along w that there are many other factors indicating her decline. Unlike X and Paraxenes, Nylon and Apago are considered to be commercial failures. Everything I said above was from newspapers and sources, but obviously I wouldnt waste time putting it on my talk page, b/c again my comments were more directed to Greekboy. If you look it up, her 2008 tour and the fab show were not very successful. Vandi's tour for one beat vissi's and there was actually a direct comparisson made between the s club and fab, saying that the former's success was very impressive when even vissi's highly promoted show was not doing well. If you think about it, why would she invite Rouvas to perform at athinon with her if she had fully supported the show the year before. Athinon is a big club and she on average only filled half of it. According to Forbes Vissi got 26k euros last year and is getting 22k euros this year, whereas rouvas got 18k last year and 20k this year, the only person to increase. To Vima among others have cited Paparizou as replacing Vissi and Vandi in the late 2000s and Avopolis said Vissi was trying to catch up to her. Don't get me wrong a Paparizou (or Vandi) fan I am not, but unless you are completely blinded by being a fan you can see that in the past half decade Paparizou has been the most culturally relevant female contemporary artist.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Editing the lead
SSZvH7N5n8, could I ask you again to discuss any substantive changes to the lead here on talk first? The current lead has consensus, both from this most recent discussion, and from a previous one (thinking now in particular about the second paragraph), where Bilby, who has an academic background in this area, was very helpful in suggesting how to approach it, and agreed with the end result. 

The changes you made to it  removed the two key names, and left it reading oddly. This is the lead section of the parent article of the animal rights pages on Wikipedia, so the writing has to be reasonably clear. That doesn't mean it's written in stone, but please suggest changes here so that we can consider your arguments.

Also, """"animal rights"""" and """"animal liberation"""" are used interchangeably on Wikipedia and throughout most of the academic literature.  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

adbe59b084075f49,"All of the fuss about Patent Trolls is driving coalitions of technology sector leaders to Washington, D.C. with their support of this year’s Patent Reform Legislation.  With all the fanfare, it is perfect timing for the Original Patent Troll to make his comeback in the recent re-release of The Patents Video.

In 1994, the Patent Troll made his first appearance in The Patents Video.  At its first release, The Patents Video was purchased by hundreds of corporations, universities, governmental entities and law firms.  In The Patents Video, an unsuspecting victim is surprised by the Original Patent Troll who strategically positioned himself to collect patent licensing revenue.

Using dramatic vignettes, entertaining scenarios, humor and expert advice, The Patents Video explains the most commonly misunderstood concepts and the most critical information about patents.  The Patents Video was designed to visually make key messages memorable.  Topics include intellectual property (IP) law basics, domestic and foreign patent bar dates, patenting of ideas, and claim language with respect to patent infringement.  

Engineers, scientists, marketers, managers, executives and corporate attorneys have a lesson in Bar Dates that no one forgets when they watch The Patents Video.   Og, a caveman in a dream, has invented the wheel.  Og and Thak push the wheel through downtown – all in public view.  The Patents Video, an entertaining educational tool, explains how and why Og and Thak have lost their foreign patent filing rights and explains, in detail, how to avoid triggering U.S. and foreign patent Bar Dates.  

A free viewing of a 3.5 minute clip from the 32 minute video is available by visiting www.ogandthak.com.   YouTube viewers give the clip Five Stars.

As somewhat of an aside perhaps, don't get me wrong...I fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a Jewish community should become a part of that community, adopting its minhagim as his own.  This is the ruling according to Beth Yosef.  So, when Ashkenazim have settled there, they should have become an integral part of the Bukharan community, as Bukharans.  (The real """"aside"""" is the egregious nature of the establishment of the Rishon LeTziyon """"Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi"""" ba'aretz, in contravention of halakha.)  The reason I ask is because there seems to be a concentration on these individuals with apparently Russified names, if not originally Ashkenazim themselves, and the """"native Bukharans"""" apparently warrant no mention.  Did the Russian Jews that seriously dominate the locals, economically, or did the Bukharans Russify their surnames in order to ingratiate themselves to their Russian domineers?

Allow me to outline a scenario. On an article about a TV program there is a redlink to an actor who appeared in a one-line role, and were know as Taxi Driver #2. The article is created, but as they have only ever appeared in one episode of a TV program where there part consisted of six words, the article is tagged with a CSD A7, another user removes the tag, the article is PROD-ed, on day 6.5 the PROD is removed the article goes to AfD, then five days later id deleted, because the actor fails the GNG and WP:ACTOR, the link turns red again. I would argue that Marshall's brothers and Carl the bartender may have appeared in enough episodes of HIMYM to get articles, but if HIMYM is all they have done then they fail the GNG. Given that day players are unlikely to ever bass the bar for GNG there is little point in redlinking every extra on HIMYM. The director of Zombieland deserves an article, Boy #1 in episode 9 of season 5 of HIMYM does not. Red links are useful, but redlinks everywhere do not help.

 I contend that in the first section, yes Legalese makes a valid point that he does majorly include points to support his edits also, but my assertion that the second section (""""Be civil IAF"""") is meant solely for a personal attack. It merely has the cloak of redundant information i.e. which was already posted earlier by Legalese in another section, and its main aim (as the title itself suggests) is to lecture me about what he percieves is """"civility"""". On this, Legalese definitely deserves a warning .

Again, I may repeat that I have dealt with utmost consternation AND with due respect (while mentioning the Hon'ble SC) my opinion on the judgement which may qualify as Contempt of Courtsomething which Legalese has not and probably does not even bother to looking on the Talk-page. The purpose of repeatedly levelling baseless charges of Contempt of Court, despite my clarification on the same in the talk-page earlier is beyond my comprehension.

The charge that I am not being a """"good"""" editor can only be levelled as a matter of opinion only, (which I too can leve back at him) and not as a complaint because Legalese is NOT an admin, has no authority, has had no authority on wikipedia on matters related to the judgement of the quality of articles, and even final arbitration on what constitutes as """"good editing"""" or """"Objectionable behaviour"""".

His lecture to me on civility (that too publicly on a talk-page and not on my user:page) is itself very appaling to me-who has been contributing to wikipedia since more than a year now. What is even more appaling is his assumption of a role as the Moral Guardian and as someone who discerns the quality of edits. For attempting to accuse me of AND impose the norms of """"civility"""" and that too incongruous on a talk-page of an article and not personally on my own talk-page, Legalese deserves a warning.

Besides, I never said that I find the """"word-war"""" offending to me on part of Legalese. So an Unconditional Apology on my part does not arise at all. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

f1bb8b0f202d3679,"Introduction & the article 

Hi new poster here, ive been following the article for a few weeks, I have reviewed the external links good and bad and have a few ideas.  The controversy that surrounds this organization seems to be based between nichiren shoshu(in japan) and sgi(international) with alot of the groundwork coming from japan where the organizations originated from.  After looking around and comparing to the other religions and sects, i propose we seperate the criticisms from each article and make a new article that, most likely, will be a cite war.  
  The benefit is two-fold.  First, the articles relating to each sect of buddhism talk about THAT buddhism, what they do, where they came from, etc etc, and not talk about the criticisms that anyone may have about them(similar to the anti-christianity criticism article and others).  This is the most NPOV solution i can up with.  Also, having a criticisms oriented paragraph in the intoduction seems extremely bias against an organization that promotes culture and peace(i have seen some demonstrations, nothing on a global scale or read about the political party, has anyone btw?)  Secondly, in the split article section, the details can come out a little more clearly as they arent presented on the article talking about a buddhist sect, its an article about how the sect is impacting the world.  It just seems a bit more accurate.  
  Hopefully i will have a viable solution setup after i do some more reading about editing etc... Thoughts?",0,0,0,0,0,0

e7d3543815292a53,"""::::::: Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
 I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid?Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page. 
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.
God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

Hi, Cirt - I hope you will consider stopping accusing me of bad faith editing. If you have any qualms with particular edits, I'd love to hear what is wrong with them and how my approach can be improved. 

I'd like to direct your attention to two quotes on user pages. The first is from Jimmy Wales:

== You can edit this page! ==

Really, you can! If you would like to, please feel free to do so. Make an edit – or even several! After all, that is what Wikipedia is all about.''

And the second is from Neelix's user page:

Wikipedia is thoroughly, inherently collaborative. In the humanities division of academia, we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius, expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. We write better when we write together.

I think those principles are pretty neat. And I am certain my editing adheres to them. If you'd like to contact me off the site, let me know - I'd be happy to share ways to get in touch.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Bull shit I bet they be sucking alot of dick! My Page wasn't vandalism it was truthism. Look for you self:

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day
You were supportive of the idea that Jehochman proposed: """"A message is most effective when it matches the format of the media. We're an encyclopedia. On Feb 11, I suggest we fill our front page with articles, blurbs and news about mass spying and privacy. That will send a strong message, and help educate people. It's sort of like what we do on April 1, except serious instead of foolish.""""

Since this proposal received so much support, I and several others have done our best to begin the process of implementation.   That said, the proposal is very controversial with Main Page insiders who have, understandably, objections that boil down to WP:NOTADVOCATE.

It's valuable to have feedback from people who oppose any deviation from the status quo, but we really need feedback from people who understood Jehochman idea, supported it, and could tell us whether we're succeeding in """"implementing the vision"""" that Jehochman laid out and how to improve the proposal.    

If you have the time, would you lend your view over at Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day.  If you want to see a list of custom content that could be available, we have a Arbitrary mockup #2, that shows lots of proposed content on one page. 

Your feedback is most appreciated.   

Awesome to see the proposal come this far! I've been a bit busy this weekend, but I'll try to provide input where I can. Thanks for the update, ~ Talk Contribs

 Are you bored or what? 

Please read the text and the irritation source text carefully on the nonsense you have replaced on my talk page. You have reposted this notice from another editor without any basis, similar the original editor, making the notice, unwarranted and complete nonsense.  Hundreds of lines of discussion on the talk page were in progress and a consensus was reached to include the edits I did. The original reverter obviously had not read any of the history, used a nonsense POV excuse and labelled it """"(Reverted good faith edits by 99.251.114.120 (talk):"""". His previous edit was four minutes prior so it was obvious no research was performed. Next some, obviously ignorant of the situation, person decided to post a warning on my webpage based on a POV assumption. I removed it labelled it just as it was """"nonsense""""
Please stay off my talk page with this nonsense. Comments and valid warnings are completely welcome, anytime.

Apparently I will have to take this up on the talk page of the originator of this nonsense or a flock of meatpuppets will be visiting me again. 

Here is what you reverted (in case you didn't read it previously):

===April 2012===
 
Your recent editing history at Centrifugal force shows that you are currently engaged in an edit war. Being involved in an edit war can result in your being blocked from editing—especially if you violate the three-revert rule, which states that an editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page within a 24-hour period. Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert. Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—even if you don't violate the three-revert rule—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.
 
To avoid being blocked, instead of reverting please consider using the article's talk page to work toward making a version that represents consensus among editors. You can post a request for help at a relevant noticeboard or seek dispute resolution. In some cases, you may wish to request temporary page protection.

2c5dd9a3342a9b2d,"Unbelieveable. Absolutely unbelieveable. It had slipped my mind that I actually did try once more to knock some sense in with that remark on the infallible doctor's talk page. That was a mistake. A momentary lapse of reason. I'd somehow got it into my head that somehow, someway, just the slightest degree of sensibility would kick in. I'd forgotten that logic has no place here.

Clio basically told Dirk he doesn't know shit, and so I basically parrotted that back to her in order to try to point out to you guys once again for the zillionth time that you're letting her get away with murder.

And then came the ugliness. I'd forgotten about the whole thing until just now when I noticed in my contributions that I'd apparently made a remark on her page. Talk about a personal attack. I swear I've rarely seen such sickening thoughts put into words. And all about me. Such anger, such twisted hatred, such disturbed imagery...

No. I don't care how irritating this whole thing is. It's not worth it. This girl is not well, and NEITHER of us are helping. Haven't you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? Haven't you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person? Do you not realize how responsibile you are for having actively participated in the transformation of the Humanities RefDesk from once being a vibrant place where one could find a multifaceted, multidimensional answer written by a variety of differing editors, each with his own invaluable unique insights and perspectives, into the stale, single-faceted unidimensional, useless place it is now?

No. It's not worth it. It's futile. Worse actually. Perhaps I share in some of the blame myself. If it wasn't for my relentless protestations, perhaps the whole thing would have blown over, Clio would have gotten bored of the Humanities RefDesk, moved on, and it wouldn't be the cold, sterile place it is now.

Perhaps I lost perspective, and didn't realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.

Just please read the damn thing over, Rockpocket. Here it is:  . Those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. I recognize that now. I have to stop. What I'm doing is wrong. So to all who will inevitably read this, I say publicly to Clio:

You win. I lose. You're right. I'm wrong. You're smart and you were right all along, I'm an intellectually impoverished imbecile. Yes, as you say, I'm pathetic. I'm honestly, genuinely sorry for having caused you such grief. I don't belong editing here on Wikipedia as I can't even approach your level of intelligence. I wish you nothing but health and happiness. Be well.

The problem here, brangifer, and the thing that (as an academic) annoys me the most, is that you are doing something that no scholar would ever do.  You are starting from a pre-defined judgement (i.e., that anything not-science is bad) and working your way backwards to find supporting evidence for that position.  One can always find someone reputable, somewhere, who says what one already believes - ufologists do that all the time, cherry-picking quotes from scientists and government agencies -  but it's bad scholarship to do so.

Actually I'll address the concerns (as the site admin). The site truly has too much ads. The links in the menu are a bit misleading and Its one of the things that I intend to remove very soon. Any other ad unit however will remain in place. The profits just barely cover the costs of maintaining the site not to mention the time I invest in regular updates. So if any ads at all are a problem by itself I can't say much. But I think every site has its own way of funding itself, and as long as the information is free and th ads are reasonalby placed its oaky.
As for the Cuban style only concern. Salsa Lust is not intended to be Cuban\Casino style only (actually it's even covering some Miami style moves too). Salsa Lust suppose to cover other styles too with LA as the first next candidate, but it might take some time until it happens for various reasons. So by looking at the rules presented it might be true that it's more relevent to the Cuban/Casino-style specific salsa article however it won't take too long until it will be relevant to this page as well.

 All this argument crap. 

In my opinion, 
a) Notability is established in this article in the fact that One Bid is a qualifying game played 6 times a show, every show, 5 days a week, on a highly rated network game show, and has been an element of every version of the show since the original. It would be ideal to have some other citations to show it's been recognized outside of the show itself, but I believe sufficient notability has been met, and the tag needn't be there.

b) Original research. If you are read the tag, it says """"See talk page for details."""" If you are not going to either tag with  or start a talk page section explaining what you believe is original research (or be more specific by tagging only the relevant sections), then I don't believe the tag should stand

c) I think this article does need more citations. I think almost every article on wikipedia needs more citations than are currently there. However, since there isn't even a single  tag on the article, I don't see what specific information is felt to be requiring citation. As I understand it, Wikipedia practice allows primary sources (in this case, the show itself) to act as a source for anything relevant to rules and how the game is played and what happens. So if there are major uncorroborated facts in the article, you ought to tag them specifically to justify a refimprove banner tag

d) The merge discussion seems to have been abandonned. I believe it should be appropriately revived and an actual pro/con vote be taken, or else abandon the merge tag. I see no evidence of support from the discussion linked to in the tag.

This is my opinion as to how the tags should be dealt with. It is not sufficient to just say """"original research exists in this article so I'm going to slap a tag at the top."""" (for example). These tags should be supported by specific explainations or pointers to actual problematic content unless the entire article really needs citing or is original research, which I don't find to be the case here.

Remove – Entire article is of questionable notability. There also appears to be an agenda here, being pushed, often through tag-team and uncivil retorts, on this talk page. Wiki seems to turn more into 4chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of """"not censored"""" rhetoric, each day. I'm waiting for a photo of a """"sheep shagger"""" to appear on Welsh or Scottish article, under the guise of """"notability"""". Some editors here have serious pro-gay COI/POV issues and need to step back, especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of """"homophobia"""" out of turn. Why is the solo female fister a cartoon, and the male fister a photo, for a start? Not very neutral. Why does there even need to be a photo, when all the article needs is a description – I mean, it's hardly rocket science, and that guy hardly has a """"rocket"""" worth shouting about? You don't need a photo on how to boil eggs, so why one here? Again, it's anti-Wiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids, more agenda/politically motivated, more pornographic, less educational, detrimental to every other article/contributor who wants to see Wiki develop. Sadly, it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. Gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites, when they themselves use """"not censored"""" as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers. Age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination. Photos such as this are what lead to the Foundation considering an """"image filter"""" recently. I'm pro-LGB (-T) but I also believe in """"behind closed doors"""". And I disagree with anyone who says kids won't look it up. When I was young kids looked """"dirty words"""" up in the dictionary. Now the internet is here, and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds. Let's put it this way: because of """"no legal threats"""", no LGBT members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this.

 Islamic Science 

There's been some discussion previously of the need for an article on the History of Islamic Science.  At present there is a small section of that sort in the article on Islamic Science.

There's a real potential for tension there because two different groups are interested in the topic of Islamic Science, and these two groups define it in very different ways. I am concerned that the different assumptions of these two groups may lead to unnecessary conflict, which can be avoided by dividing the present article in two.

 The article """"Islamic science"""" seems to have been founded by advocates of a modern intellectual movement called """"Islamic science,"""" which seeks to establish the practice of science within a particular set of traditional Islamic religious norms. Thus the article defines """"Islamic science [as] science in the context of traditional religious ideas of Islam, including its ethics and philosophy. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist. This is not the same as science as conducted by Muslims in the secular context"""" (my emphasis).

 Historians of science, on the other hand, find this definition excessively constraining, since we investigate the ways in which scholars within the Islamic world developed scientific ideas through original research and by drawing on and transforming the ideas of their neighbors and predecessors. It really doesn't matter to historians of science whether the particular scientist was Muslim (e.g., al-Khwarizmi), Sabian (e.g., Thabit ibn Qurra), Christian (e.g., Hunain ibn Ishaq), or Jewish (e.g., Hasdai ibn Shaprut), whether he advocated strict adherence to Muslim traditions (e.g. al-Ghazzali) or was critical of tradition and open to the ideas of foreign philosophers (e.g. Averroës), or whether he worked in a religious or secular context. If he studied natural phenomena and worked within the Islamic world, his work fits the historians' broader definition of Islamic science.

These contradictory expectations are likely to lead to conflict in two or more different ways:

 When historians wish to discuss scholars who don't follow traditional Islamic religious norms, while advocates of the modern movement would wish to delete these from the discussion. 

 When advocates of the modern Islamic science movement wish to discuss those modern scholars who contribute to the development of that movement, while historians would wish to delete them as not relevant to the historical development of science in Islamic cultures. 

Rather than go this unhappy route, I propose an amicable divorce, removing the section on the History of Islamic Science (perhaps renamed History of Science in Islam) and making it a separate article under the History of Science portal, and leaving the remaining article on Islamic Science as part of the series of articles on Islam.

Instead, the operation of group dynamics, e.g., of one group of editors / administrators, """"sitting"""" on a article using about a controversial topic (the MRM article is but one example) by using inappropriate administrative sanctions undermines the mission and reliability of WP.
Until WP can reliably address these issues, I'm afraid that some WP articles will be terribly inaccurate and/or biased.  

The downside of this, of course, is that WP is hemorrhaging editors  many of whom are highly knowledgeable professionals or academics who simply do not wish to invest their time dealing with biased wikilawyering.

ive posted this on the clairvoyance talk page after someone completely removed the clar#irsentience article which had gone through a process of months of work , rewrites , endless discussion , removasl of personal matereal , edits for style and content .... endless work on correct sourcing and wikpedia referencing and formatting.....  the article which had been arrived at with co operation and discussion over many weeks and v man who himself put some hours into grammer , punctuation ... re editting for stlye and content ... and much help in correct sourcing and referencing  ..... 

this article was the sum  of many peoples input , effort and hard work  so i dont know how or who removed it so thoughtlessly and put the meaningless redirect to the clairvoyance page... any help would be great.... cheers..  

hi guys

i see youve redirected  the clairsentience article.... let me ask....what was the point of the weeks of discussions and rewrites if you guys were going to redirect it anyway....you should have told me t get lost out of here...... what was the point of it all?  why did i listen to you ? at all?  why did i remove all personal references?  why did i reference and source all of my matereal diligently and in great detail ?  why did i edit and re edit for style and content ?  why did i make additional references to religios , anthropological ,socialogical , philosophical ,medical , physics , chemistry , botany , mental health etc  so that all views were included and respected?  why did i fulfill all of the above hurdles and hoops to fulfill wikpedia formatting and guidlines for you too to delete months of hard work and effort.  your actions are without integrity or honour ..... 

clairsentience article redirect ?

Hi ..... whoever removed the clairsentience article and made it redirect ... can you please try and respect that the article that was there had evolved over a couple of months of discussion and many rewrites and multiple edits which involved much discussion over a long period......
.........i could delete this clairvoyance article.... but i wont because revert and delete wars then stupidly take place   which is a real shame when a library becomes a bar room brawl......

..... i hope you can respect the clairsentience article...

..... ive been clairsentient for most of my adult life and it wasnt easy to come this far and to struggle for  decades to articulate my experience in a way which makes rational sense to the world at large of which the clairsentience article is a manifest example..... so please try and respect the vast amount of struggle and work which has gone into it....",0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, we've disposed of the first paragraph (partly merged and partly shown to be dubious).  The comment """"according to the playwright Christopher Marlowe as reported by the informer Richard Baines"""" can probably be backed up by a more reliable source, but it seems hearsay that tells us nothing about the subject of this article, and quite possibly not even about Marlowe (although I note it is mentioned in Sexuality of Jesus).

 Seth Material 

Oasis, thank you for the supportive comments that you made on the Seth Material talk page recently.

If you are truly a new editor, there are some things you need to know.  Wikipedia's rules governing editing and the behavior of editors are very poorly written.  They encourage people who have nothing else to do to spend hours and hours on the site each day.  However, once an editor has exhausted his knowledge, any contributions he makes after that are of dubious value.  The result is that there are contingents of what I call """"Wiki-addicts"""" who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves """"skeptics"""", and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several """"skeptics"""" ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by """"Itsmejudith"""".  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted.

Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tila Nguyen
Hello,

I see you've deleted Tila Nguyen from Category:Porn stars and List of heterosexual erotic actresses.  I know Tila does mostly softcore work, but if you search around you will see she appears in films caressing other women in the nude and in a very explicitly sexual manner that is intended to arouse the viewer.  I think she at least qualifies as an erotic actress, even if not completely a porn star.   04:22, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 Cuyamaca 

I noticed that you added the merge tag to Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca, California. I originally created a single article but it seemed to me that towns and villages tend to have dedicated articles so I split the article in two. I'm inclined to agree that a single article would be sufficient. Is this consistent with other articles that cover a city, town or village and the like-named region in which they sit? If so, in your opinion, should the articles be consolidated under """"Cuyamaca"""" or """"Cuyamaca, California""""?  17:58, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I couldn't find enough information about the village to expand it so I merged Cuyamaca with Cuyamaca, California and marked Cuyamaca for deletion. I assume that all the other particulars, such as the duplicate article page, will be taken care of.  00:51, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

UK railway stations - J
Hi. I've reverted your wikification of the UK railway stations - J page. By convention, the entries in the leftmost column are only wikilinked once there is a railway station article for the town/city/locale. Your links go to what are, in the context of a list of UK railway stations, random pages ( best wishes

 Northern vs. Southern California speech 

In response to your question on the Regional American English talk page, I think it would be fascinating to see a section on differences between Northern and Southern California speech, especially since both regions seem to have distinct characters. Of course, it would be helpful if you could provide other examples, but the one you cited would be a good start, too.  20:19, Nov 7, 2004 (UTC)

Jeff, are you sure that her surname is Lee? In the English context, evidence is provided that she is Lee, Sung Hi or Sung Hi-Lee, which says that Sung is her surname.

If you have any comments/questions please reply to my talk page.   04:36, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)

71d280f52f349463,"Úbeda 

Hello, sorry for the long message.

In March 2005, there was a WP:RM request and vote (which you took part in) to move Úbeda to Ubeda, with a 6-3 result, see  Talk:Ubeda#Requested_move:_.C3.9Abeda_.E2.86.92_Ubeda (or perhaps here if renamed).

However, beginning in April 2005 and lasting several months, there was a survey conducted at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Proposal and straw poll regarding place names with diacritical marks, with dozens of participants voting and discussing over an extended period of time.  The purpose of the survey was to try to gather feedback for what the policy should be globally.  Proponents of diacritics were in the majority, and in general, use of diacritics is widespread in actual practice on Wikipedia today (particularly since the Mediawiki upgrade to Unicode).

However, for Úbeda/Ubeda, Philip Baird Shearer is stating that the WP:RM vote takes precedence over the survey results, and a new WP:RM vote would be required to move it to Úbeda.  My position is that there should be a global policy rather than case-by-case voting  that was the whole purpose of the survey.  In discussion with him, I wrote:
Just as we wouldn't have case-by-case voting on, say, capitalization issues for articles (eg, prepositions in movie and book titles should be lowercase, globally), we shouldn't have case-by-case voting on diacritic issues.
See the discussion at Talk:Ubeda#Talk_page_discussion_on_page_move (or perhaps here if renamed).

As a possible alternative to calling a new WP:RM vote which might set a precedent for case-by-case voting across thousands of articles, I am polling all the participants of the original WP:RM vote to ask:
 Regardless of how you voted in the WP:RM voting, which do you believe should take precedence: the earlier WP:RM vote on the specific article, or the subsequent survey?

Note, since Philip Baird Shearer was one of the participants in that vote, he will also be receiving this message and thus will have the opportunity to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Consecrated life 

I think the discussion of """"Tertiaries and oblates"""" is excessive detail for an article of this scope and should be dropped.  I would reduce the section to just the lead sentence and thus the last two sections of the """"Consecrated life"""" section would now read:

Tertiaries and """"Oblates (regular)"""" are laypersons who live according to the third rule of orders such as those of the Secular Franciscan Order or Lay Carmelites, either within a religious community or outside.  The Church recognizes several other forms of consecrated life, including secular institutes, societies of apostolic life and consecrated widows and widowers. It also makes provision for the approval of new forms.

Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1,0,1,0,0,0

(""""Everytime I hear the word """"culture"""", I reach my revolver"""" Herman Goering)

He lost his father at age 7 and was taken out of school to live at a village at age 8. He was beaten sensless by his tutor at age 10 and was taken out of his new school again. He failed to achieve cumulative average score for his favorite school he always dreamt of, at age 17. He was arrested when 24, interrogated for days and put in solitary cell confinement for two months. He was 25 when sent to exile. When his colleague associate and close friend that is one year older than him was declared a hero by the association that he was serving, nobody noted him. When he was fighting to save cities from foreign occupations at age 30, his hometown fell to the enemy. His superior lobbied for him to be sent away to get rid of him when he was 30. He was left idle at his new location and could not get paid for months. He was in a hospital in Vienna for renal treatment confined to a bed for months lonely when he was 37. When returned to work, the army he would command was disbanded. He was fired by the Minister of Defense at age 38. He owned no civilian clothes to wear, no money saved and had to borrow a coat from a friend. An arrest warrant was issued for him the same year. A death order was issued for him when 39. He became the President of the Turkish republic when he was 42. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk read 18 thousand volumes of books in which over 200 000 lines are highlighted. Tens of thousands of sidenotes were entered. When found with red weepy eyes, he said his only worry was burning eyes which he took care of yards of soft fabric he'd ordered by his side to dry his eyes. He put his signature under the biggest changes and revolutions of his time. His farewell was equally impressive and touching with the last words of ‘.. and peace be upon you..’ in the morning of November 10, 1938 when Turkey was just waking up.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

This conflict is called """"civil war"""" by some - but officially it's not (yet, everyone acknowledges it may BECOME, and this practically any moment - imagine, for example, if the Sunnis assassinated Sistani). The UN people are (neutral) experts and they say it's """"Islamic extremism"""" (and they were actually hit in one of the insurgent attacks, unrelated to the sectarian violence - talking about """"being there""""). You are just an amatour and the UN wouldn't even ask you for your opinion - get over it. Problem is, people can go here and think the so-much-talked for years now (""""sliding towards"""", """"escalating into"""") civil war is declared and going on, and get confused. This is misleading, to say it mildly. If you are aware of that, this is vandalising. When I first came there, it was even worse - the insurgency (including attacks against Coalition forces) was confused with the sectarian violence (probably copy-pasted without thinking). 

Oh, and don't talk silly (crazy?) about some """"flowers and music"""". Anyway, I'll answer seriously: the main articles for you are Iraq war, Iraqi insurgency, sectarian violence in Iraq - as the articles' titles alone say, there is """"war"""", """"insurgency"""", and """"violence"""" going on there, each one connected to another (well, Iraqi music is actually too). There are also multiple sub-articles - plenty of these, some with the names like """"massacre"""" (as for your """"BLOODBATH""""). There even articles on the casualties. Here, you can go back if the """"civil war"""" officially started (that is, declared by the other side-the Shia militias, the government of Iraq, or the UN - the media will start calling it by this name, too).

 StillStanding-247 

I'm sorry you feel that way. You obviously didn't do much research then, you certainly didn't look at the lies and false accusations of sockpuppetry constantly thrown at StillStanding by the POV group he was running into; you didn't look into the harassment he received, the constant threats and promises of a campaign to have him blocked.

You can accuse me of assuming bad faith if you want, but he had editors talking about him in veiled terms like """"our mutual friend"""", talking about strategies to get him blocked, talking about having him blocked for creating a draft RfC page, and who actively went to have others blocked for trying to research diffs for that same page. There was no """"good faith"""" involved in this, there was a pattern of bad-faith edits by a battleground-mentality POV group who happened to find a set of sympathetic admins to their cause.

Commenting on the evidence, I would like to assert which were done by me and which were not (I don't really know what to do, or what I can do, in these sort of situations, so this is all I can offer right now). Evidence 1,3,4, and 5 were done by me, and evidence 2,6, and 7 were not. Evidence 1 was me making an edit (logged in) to the page Aang, as I often make small edits to pages I am familiar with. Evidence 2 was not me, as I do not use profanity. Evidence 3 was me (logged in) following the guidelines given to me as I faced a block message, and the aforementioned guidelines were to paste a link on my page to remove the block. Now this is where I am a bit confused. Evidence 4 was me (NOT logged in) removing the Welcome! template that was on my user page, but I did this a few weeks ago (I believe that date listed is July 25). I removed it because I felt I no longer needed it and generally dislike it when my page is not edited by me, which I assume led to Evidence 5. Evidence 5 was me (logged in) removing the Unblocked message from my page, and although I do not know what """"snarky"""" is (I hope it isn't an insult), I removed the template, again, because I generally dislike it when other people edit my page (I understand that in this situation the edit to my page was to alert me of the unblock, but I was assuming that message would be sent via inbox rather than a direct edit). As for Evidence 6 and 7, I am not user Hermanthegerman66, and I would guess that IP 24.7.247.203 is also Hermanthegerman66 but not at the library.

Thanks for your intervention on this page.  I agree you're probably right to remove the lengthy footnote, but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different, namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse (which is, I imagine, the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place).  I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.  A few points however:
You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article.
There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.  
The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am.
Your criticism is a little disparaging.  It may of course be both accurate and justified, but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude.  Perhaps it needs charity?

Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

 Article Licensing 

Whenever I need a WikiVacation, sometimes I go back to working on articles that absolutely no one would think to write about so they leave me alone.  Anyway if you ever come back and have a moment to consider this, I've """"started"""" the  which aims to get users to release all of their contributions to the U.S. state, county, and city articles (if any) under the CC-by-sa 1.0 and 2.0 license (at minimum) or into the public domain if they prefer.  A secondary, but equally important, goal is to get those users to release ALL of their edits for ALL articles.  I've personally chosen to multi-license all of the  and  contributions under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License so that other projects, such as WikiTravel, can use our articles.  I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all your contributions (or at minimum those on the geographic articles) so that we can keep most of the articles available under the multi-license.  Many users use the {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} template (or even {{MultiLicensePD}} for public domain) on their user page, but there are other templates for other options at Template messages/User namespace.  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 100.  If you do want to do it, simply just copy and paste one of the above two templates into your user page and it will allow us to track those users who have done it. For example:

Option 1
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}
OR
Option 2
I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below:
{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}

Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain (which many people do or don't like to do, see Wikipedia:Multi-licensing), you could replace {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} with {{MultiLicensePD}}   00:10, Nov 26, 2004 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I want to first congratulate you on over 21,000 contributions.  I know first hand the feeling you get when achieving great things.  You and your fellow administrators have made, and continue to make, Wikipedia a brilliant place to go for correct information.  I want to apologize if the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_J._Esposito (Brian J. Esposito) violated any of these internal rules.  I was under the impression that my accomplishments which were sourced by companies such as Inc. Magazine, Hearst Publications, BIR Report, Beauty Store Business, Asbury Park Press, KikScore, The National Retail Federation, NRF and many more were valid enough.  I would like to work with you in correcting any issues and to have this page restored.  I am continuing to make great strides for my companies, employees, and my family.  Having this page also acted as a way of helping me continue to accomplish my goals and dreams.  I look forward in hearing back from you and also learning from you on how to correctly do the right thing when it comes to Wikipedia.

Thank you for your time,

 logic, please: the primary reason to date for retaining this picture is NOTCENSORED; that is a misapplication of policy if the image has no encyclopedic value, therefore IAR is applied to remove that reason, which allows for removing the image as unencyclopedic.  Editing policy only applies if (again) the content has encyclopedic value, which is exactly the point I'm disputing.  and last I checked (if this were a vote, which it isn't) the RfC was 9 to 6 in favor of removing, though some of the 6 in favor of keeping put a lot of effort into rationalizing that result away.

 Ward Churchill Admits that He is a Lying SOB 

Dear , Ward Churchill admitted in front of dozens of reporters and in front of TV cameras, last night, February 22, 2005, that he is NOT in fact an Indian.  He has been lying about his heritage for many, many years and people like me, who live and work in Indian Country everyday, have known for years that he was out and out lying about his heritage.  I repeat:  Ward Churchill during his speech at the University of Hawaii admitted that he is NOT an Indian.

I'm going to attempt to be gracious but I have to say that you and  missed the boat on this one.

These """"allegations"""" of """"fabrications"""" have been provable facts of fabrications.  It calls into questions so many other things about the guy.  What other things is he out and out lying about???  But more importantly the way that the section on his fake Indian heritage needs to be completely re-written.  Considering the arrogant and sanctimous way that he has treated people like me in Indian Country who dared to question his Indian heritage claims over the years, I think that Indian heritage section needs to play a more centralized role in the article and tomorrow that role is coming.  So many peoplewho do NOT even live in Indian Country, who do NOT work in Indian Countrymade the claim that to dare question the great Ward Churchill's fake Indian heritage was a """"cheap shot.""""  We have been hearing that from non-Indians for many, many years and now Churchill has admitted that he lied about it for over 20 years.  He claims that it merely a misunderstanding created by some sloppy reporters.  That is a damn lie too.  He has been claiming Indian heritage for over 20 years.  It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.  He committed fraud when he applied to the University of Colorado.  The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes.  That is a damned lie.

Scjessey then reverted the edit.  This is fine, too, as again we assume good faith.

Though I certainly understand what the author was thinking, not everything considered """"pornographic"""" by everyone's standards is necessarily """"hyperreal.""""  Without delving into the differing definitions of pornography, there's a specific example I can think of which illustrates my argument.  Let's say someone makes an amateur video of him or herself having intercourse, and let's postulate that this person decides to sell said video for whatever reason.  Since it's a depiction of a sex act and it's being distributed, this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions.  Nothing about it, however, is inherently hyperreal.  Someone might be interested in purchasing it for the purpose of sexual arousal, and I acknowledge that being aroused by a digital representation is clearly a """"hyperreal"""" act, but that doesn't make this piece of pornography hyperreal in and of itself.  This might be an odd example, but I think it serves to illustrate that """"pornography"""" is too vague and subjective a concept to consider inherently hyperreal.  But perhaps I'm totally wrong.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The tide of opinion is moving against AGW,  and certainly against CO2, being particularly potent cause of climate change.    
Rather than surveying scientists, look at the fundamentals.  Effects of water are dominant over CO2.   I’m told that IPCC models apply controversial positive feedback factors to enhance the effect of CO2, and using values that are too high would explain why their models do not fit recent observations.  Illustrative links follow: -

Water vapour dominates.

Beyond thst, clouds complicate the effects of water, which in a complete study needs to be considered in its three phases.

However, global mean temperature does not correlate with atmospheric CO2 concentration on a geological time scale:

You know, I'm not really sure. I don't imagine there would be a problem just removing all the text from AFD and listing at WP:RFD. However, the afd2 page would need to be deleted by a sysop.

 Leading paragraphs for articles 

Hi SamClark, this is just a comment that was made to me, that I thought I would pass onto you, for you to think about and respond how you please. The leading paragrpahs in Global Justice, and your draft at User:Sam Clark/justice read like the introduction to an essay. Particularly the last sentences which say what the article will discuss. This is what I did when I created a few articles from scratch, mainly because the only type of writing I ever do is for essays. But a couple of people have commented that as an encyclopaedic article, the first section is more like a synopsis rather than an introduction, and would generally just sum up the points of the rest of the article.

For instance, instead of 
It considers the various ways in which justice has been understood, distinguishes two broad kinds of justice, and then describes several theories of justice under each of those two headings.
It could say something like:
There are various ways to understand justice, but generally you ca distinguish between two kinds of justice: distributive justice and retributive justice. Distributive justice is concerned with the proper distribution of good things while Retributive justice is concerned with the proper response to wrongdoing.

And then it would just go straight into the article. If you look at most of the long-standing and comprehensive articles that seems to be the way they are written. Cheers.  

 Heh - good point. In my case, it's being in the habit of writing lecture-notes, but the same point applies. I'll change. Thanks,  

 Rewrite of Justice 

I think it would be great to see the derivation of the word justice from the latin (not the french) etc and perhaps a section on history on how our understanding of the term has evolved (ie. what it meant in different times and different places). Justice is defintely a philosophical concept and so it is important to discuss the philosophical meanings and debates concerning justice, but it is also a political/judicial term as well as an everday term that people use and so it would be good to have all of this represented in the article eventually. I think stuff like this from the original article is very important: 
In most cases what one regards as """"just"""" (not necessarily meaning what is just) is determined by consulting established and agreeable principles, employing logic, or, natural law In specific systems justice is determined, by consulting a majority, or in social contexts where religion dominates, justice may be thought to require deference to religious texts or to spiritual guidance, under a monarchy or authoritarian state the ruler/s determined what was just and doled out justice. All of these determinants of justice have at times delivered particularlly dark periods of history where justice was seen to be absent. If a person lives under a specific set of laws in a country, concepts of """"justice"""" are often simply deferential to the existing law —the issuing of punitive reprimands for violations may be referred to as """"serving justice."""" In principle, this fits the general concept in that the individuals get what is supposedly due to them. Justice however, is a universal and absolute concept; laws, principles, religion, etc., are merely attempts to codify the concept  occasionally with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

She trounced me for it saying that I don't know what I'm doing, that she was enforcing MoS standards and it was a known problem because the page didn't show up correctly on certain monitor sizes. All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her.

WP:Lists#Lead section or paragraph no longer says """"If the meaning of the list's title seems obvious, e.g. List of dog breeds, the article may open with a simple statement using wikilinks, e.g. 'This is a list of dog breeds.'"""" Note also that that section and Wikipedia:Stand-alone lists#Lead and selection criteria both link to WP:LEAD, as does WP:FL?#2, which says:he lead section should briefly summarize the most important points covered in an article in such a way that it can stand on its own as a concise version of the article. It is even more important here than for the rest of the article that the text be accessible. Consideration should be given to creating interest in reading the whole article.In general, specialized terminology should be avoided in an introduction. Where uncommon terms are essential to describing the subject, they should be placed in context, briefly defined, and linked. The subject should be placed in a context with which many readers could be expected to be familiar. For example, rather than giving the latitude and longitude of a town, it is better to state that it is the suburb of some city, or perhaps that it provides services for the farm country of xyz county. Readers should not be dropped into the middle of the subject from the first word; they should be eased into it. It doesn't matter which List guideline you look at, they all refer back to WP:LEAD. Remember also that """"list"""" namespace pages differ in no way from """"article"""" namespace pages, except that one contains a list and the other contains prose.

You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.

Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.

I wrote everything I wrote from the perspective I would think the article would eventually have anyway.  So you know exactly how I would think it should be presented.

Hi Malaka,

I'm new to Wikipedia (greek-Canadian) and have noticed a strong anti-Greek bias on several articles related to Macedonia. I've been having issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#This_anon_.28apparently_User:Crossthets.29.2C_is_an_apparent_POV_Pusher.2C_evidence_below

This is a difficult battle because I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?) 

Where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. I will check back here in a couple of days. Have courage. Regards 209.161.238.86",0,0,0,0,0,0

Actually, the creator of the former Hooknose article agreed with my rationale and he personally merged it with the Human nose article, as I had suggested. It got trimmed down to one or two sentences, as I had also recommended, which is an agreeable compromise for a slang term which does have mild prominence in everyday discussions of human probosci.

You telling me to use the Sandbox and vandalizing my Talk page by putting a garish """"Warning"""" icon is totally uncalled for.  I have never added """"nonsense"""" to any Wikipedia article. If you try to slander me again I will have to report you.

If for some reason you decide to revive the Hooknose article, which seems to have been oddly close to your heart, keep in mind that you would be creating a slang article. You would thus be in violation of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_a_dictionary, which lays out one of Wikipedia's key tenets: """"Wikipedia is not a dictionary, or a slang, jargon, or usage guide."""" Your vigorous defense of the Hooknose article displayed a striking unawareness of this basic tenet.  Perhaps you care to explain?

Looking forward to your response. Best,

I agree that Stevietheman's suggestion is the most appropriate to implement. JHP, if you're talking about the 14:54, 27 June 2007 24.209.30.113 (edit #141014976) entry that I reverted, it is because the content was taken directly from the Incidents page without any regard for either (a) including the references themselves, or (b) not following the WP:BLP policy that was taking place over on that page regarding this specific incident.  If you're talking about the 22:32, 2 July 2007 Realkyhick (edit #142152748) entry that I reverted, it's because the entry contained information that was already outdated by information that was updated in the Incidents page, and the link to the Incidents page was also removed by Realkyhick at that time.  If you're talking about your edit #147620955 from the 29th, that was just a copy of the same info from the Incidents page, poorly included, and badly placed in the article  while we all agree that there should be some mention of the incident, including it in the intro section isn't really appropriate either, especially as it (in essence) duplicated information that was posted further down the page.

I doesn't matter if Collingwood win, lose or draw with Geelong next week because Collingwood has 80 points while Geelong has 72 points. As you know each win is worth 4 points so Collingwood are definitively this year's minor premiers! So please DON'T' remove Collingwood as minor premiers from this year's AFL season.

The crown prosecution service charged the gang with 75 charges relating to twenty six girls, ranging from rape to intimidating witnesses, though police believed there were many more victims. The men were charged in three separate trials. 

 Name  Conviction Abid Mohammed Saddique  rape, sexual assault, sexual activity with a child, perverting the course of justice, aiding and abetting rape, false imprisonment, making child pornography Romaan Liaqat   rape, sexual assault, aiding and abetting rape, affray, sexual activity with a child, making child pornography Akshay Kumar    making child pornography Faisal Mehmood   sexual activity with a child  Mohammed Imran Rehman   rape Graham Blackham  breaches of Sexual Offender Prevention Order 

I think that the following need to be made clear as the have quite an impact upon how content is presented and also perceived. 
 There were three trials over many months. Clarity needed. 
 The trails were covered by reporting restrictions - that affects what is reported here.
 Full details of the trials are not public domain due to the need to protect victims - UK Law Applies. 

Big Questions - 
 Does the table give undue prominence? 
 Who should be included - all accused - only the guilty - only those assessed as guilty of sexual offences - what are the criteria to be used?
 Should it list only charges found Guilty or should all charges including not guilty and dismissed be listed? 
 The Jury were unable to reach verdicts in all charges and the judge ordered they were to be left lie on file for future retrial should new evidence arise  - this needs to be addressed as it is a legal reality and on record.

Should the table address sentencing rather than charges? This may seem a cop out, but I have to point to the rights of Victims to use Wiki and not be abused by overly detailed content which does not add to overall reality. Footnotes can direct those who need full details to external sources.

Nowhere does this wiki article say Finland definitely is part of Scandinavia - it says it divides opinions, which is true. See previous discussions, also the archive. I removed the references which Supermos say don't """"prove"""" Finland is a part - but have you seen all other possible documents? Let's keep the NPOV statement that Finland sometimes is considered belonging, and that it divides opinions. You can't be more fair that that.  | Talk 

On Iceland: I for one am willing to accept that Finland """"sometimes"""" is considered belonging to Scandinavia, but as it is now, the map shows Finland on equal footing with Iceland! Iceland is never """"sometimes"""" considered belonging to Scandinavia, - it is simply not part of Scandinavia. The map is scandalous as it is now! The orange area should limit itself to Finland, and the map-text should reflect that the yellow area is in fact depicting The Nordic countries - not Scandinavia.  

Svalbard: Norway has made Svalbard a part of the kingdom, which is not in conflict with the Svalbard Treaty giving some special rights to some other nations, so perhaps Svalbard should have the same color on the map as the norwegian mainland.  

To user:janke.
It's says that """"Finland is sometimes also included"""". But that should be change to something like """"Finland is sometimes wrongly included by foreigners"""". Else we can only use the word Finland in the """"Terminology and usage"""".
Btw. """"Terminology and usage"""" is wrong. Greenland more often included as Scandinavia, than Finland, since Greenland not is all independent from Denmark. Comanche cph

The problem of ground pressure was well-understood by the US Army Ordnance Dept. during WWII. I find it difficult to identify any direct relationship between the T-34's lower ground pressure, and efforts by the US Army Ordnance Dept. to achieve similar results.  In fact, designers of both tanks were simply reacting to the conditions imposed by the European battlefield, and the Russian's worked out the solution while the American's were still getting the M4 ready for battle in the sands of N. Africa. 

Keep in mind that the relatively few engagements involving T-34s and M4s were fought mostly at relatively close ranges.  This helped mask the penetration problems of the 76mm HVAP (It was only marginally better than the AP shot round.), and led to a generalized misunderstanding of the tank's effectiveness against its Russian counterpart. I have not heard of a 90mm Sherman seeing combat in Korea.  In answer to your question about who was responsible for sending us out in undergunned death traps, it was Lt. Gen. Leslie J. McNair.  A long time staffer, McNair was a genius at organization, but demonstrated very little understanding of, or for that matter, any willingness to learn about the actual effectiveness of our tanks and tank destroyers on the battlefield.  Had he died a year earlier, we would have gone ashore in Europe equipped with 250 T26 tanks and possibly even some 90mm Shermans.  It would have made a difference.",0,0,0,0,0,0

While it's not the case that you can never delete material from your user page it is not considered acceptable to do so to new comments. I wouldn't worry too much about undeleting the comments you have already deleted but I would ask respectfully that you refrain from deleting any further comments (especially those critical of yourself).

-What needs to be established here is if the few sources that are 'against the grain' and are highly critical of the efficacy of manipulation are noteworthy or simply represent a WP:FRINGE view. IMO, Ernst & Podsanski are the only 2 authors who make bold statements about manipulation, such as 'not effective', whereas the bulk of sources suggest equivalency with usual medical care and other conservative options. Thus, I see Ernst & Podsanski as outliers, or fringe, with regard to this specific topic of manipulation for back pain. Even source #4, which you noted says equal to sham, still suggests equivalency with other therapies for back pain, including usual medical care. 
-Doc James, you seem to want to omit the common finding by multiple high-quality sources that manipulation is equivalent to usual medical care and physiotherapy for back pain? Doesn't policy indicate that the majority view gets more weight? Which theme has more weight among the available secondary sources? 1) That manipulation is not effective for back pain or 2) that manipulation is equal to 'usual medical care' for back pain? I think that we will need to decide how much weight each idea should get....hopefully this RFC will help. Also, you say you like the current text, but how does the current text """"may be as effective as other manual therapies"""" reflect the well-sourced fact that manipulation is also equivalent to usual medical care for back pain treatment?

I wonder why you say """"in good faith"""", are you implying that I'm not acting in good faith? The """"simplified one"""" is ridiculous. According to the """"simplified"""" one Spanish is only spoken near Madrid and in Andalusia, when actually it's by far the most common language throughout Spain. Obviously, regional languages exist there too, but they exist in Italy, Germany and France (actually Spain is far more homogeneous than those countries, linguistically speaking) as well, and that map simply misleads the reader. It makes you think that Spain has four equally spoken languages, whereas France, for example, only has one. That's not the case, both countries have their national language (Spanish and French, respectively) and their regional languages (Catalan, Occitan, Breton, Basque, etc.).

Let me point to the typical as I think mode of tailgaters (I only guess because I am not one) so called """"autopilot"""" when one switch off and focus only on the stop light of the car in front. This can be observed in cases when locked on to the tailgating mode, all other lanes are free to move and drive faster even within limit and surely free of obstacle of slower cars in front, but those drivers on autopilot persist and do not notice of the opportunity to change lane. Often they do tailgate for a long distance without changing lane which is free for some time and only when you decide to do so or come from behind, they come suddenly in front of you. This is partially subconscious. Our peripheral vision is sensitive to movement, their brain register this, they immediately notice that the object they notices (you) moves on or into free lane, they make immediately reactive rather than fully conscious and rational decision and they move dangerously in front of you. I believe that if they drove not on autopilot, they would long before you decided and changed lane.
I believe that such sub/un counscious behavior is a result of poor driver training. Proper training enable much better and counsious decisions and faster.

 Copyright violations 

Lightbringer, if you restore these copyright violations again, I will block you.   

Freemasonrywatch.ORG is quite clearly NOT a commercial content provider, but a personal webpage/blog, therefore your justification is completely bogus. In fact because you knowingly provided a false justification for deletion merits you being removed from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator, in addition to the previous complaint I made against you about your anti-catholic hate filled username. 

 The Epopt provides this explanation for the meaning of
 hisuserame: -Mason Boyne, Presbyterian bigot and Orange
 Lodgemember, says to his wife, “Did you know, Morag, that
 if you spell ‘Pope’ backwards you get ‘Epop,’ which is a
 four-letter word beginning with ‘E’ like ‘Evil’? You see,
 it's all there in the Bible if you just shoogle the letters
 around a bit.”

The fact that you continue to harrass and interject yourself in a complaint and arbitration between pro-occult and anti-occult editors shows your complete disregard for Wikipedia guidelines, and is further proof you should be permanently revoked from being a Wikipedia Arbitrator.   

 

 

 Letters on the Masonic Institution 

By President John Quincy Adams 

Originally Published: 
1847 T. R. Marvin 
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS 

PREFACE 

IT is now twenty years since there sprung up in the United States an earnest and at times a vehement discussion, of the nature and effect of the bond entered into by those citizens who join the society of Free and Accepted Masons. The excitement which arose in consequence of the disclosures then made, had the effect, at least for a time, if not permanently, to check the farther spread of that association. The legislative power of some of the States was invoked, and at last actually interposed, to prevent the administration of extra-judicial oaths, including of course all such as were constantly taken in the Masonic Order. This was the furthest point which the opposition ever reached. It did not succeed in procuring the dissolution of the organization of the Order, or even the repeal of the charters under which it had a recognized existence in the social system. From the moment of the adoption of a penal law, deemed strong enough to meet the most serious of the evils complained of, the apprehension of further danger from Masonry began to subside. At this day, the subject has ceased to be talked of. The attention of men has been gradually diverted to other things, until at last it may be said, that few persons are aware of the fact, provided it be not especially forced upon their notice, that not only Freemasonry continues to exist, but also that other associations partaking of its secret nature, if not of its unjustifiable obligations, not merely live, but greatly flourish in the midst of them. 

Fully aware of this state of things, a few private citizens who deeply interested themselves in the investigation of the subject when first agitated, yet feel as if their duty was not entirely performed so long as they shall have left undone any act which in their estimation may have the effect of keeping up among their countrymen a vigilant observation of the nature and tendency of secret associations. Without cherishing the remotest desire, even if they could be supposed to entertain the expectation, of reviving an old excitement, they are nevertheless most anxious to put in a permanently accessible shape, some clear and strong exposition of the evil attending similar ties, as that evil was illustrated years ago in an examination of the Freemason's Oath. Such an exposition they knew could be found in the writings of the Honorable John Quincy Adams. But although the various papers in which it was first issued to the public enjoyed an extensive circulation at the period when it was written, and without doubt contributed much to the establishment of an improved state of popular opinion, they are believed never to have been collected together in any one form readily open to the public examination. This great deficiency, it seemed to the gentlemen who have been already alluded to, a desirable object to supply. They accordingly undertook the task of publishing the present volume, not as a matter of sale, but solely with the intention of gratuitous distribution. And first of all, they deemed",0,0,0,0,0,0

Forward's device demonstrates that extraction of energy from the ZPF is possible without violating thermodynamics, and this result is confirmed by Cole/Puthoff later.  The """"zero"""" in zero-point energy is really arbitrary, with the Dirac Sea, and particular geometrical configurations of matter can create negative energy densities, as in a Casimir Cavity, thus providing a potential energy gradient for energy extraction.   21:56, 18 January 2008""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I'm accused of having multiple accounts by Noclador in his bizarre digging up of diffs (man, this guy has no life whatsoever) and then that sticks as me using sock puppets?  He makes these statements like, """"Furthermore there is socketpuppetry: user:Viewtool, user:Account101, user:Wikifun-usa, user:Nospu, user:Infinity88, user:Jamesbozen, user:Rossifumi-gp and user:Mud-miner were all incarnations of Icsunonove with which he tried to manipulate votes regarding the naming of locals in South Tyrol ceckuser results at bottom of this page"""".

Noclador
 It is amazing that Wikipedia lets this person, who is obsessively attacking another user, continue without criticism.  This person has such an extreme amount of time on his hands that he attempts to catalog diffs against another user, even surmising (with absolutely no proof) what accounts may belong to a user that are literally years old.  That this user has a Myspace page like Noclador, that has a statement such as """"noclador is ever victorious -)"""" should demonstrate what small-minded intentions he has in life.  I do pity him.  That users like PhJ and Gryffindor back him up are no surprise.  Gryffindor, as I've said before, is one of the most unethical Administrators I've ever witnessed on Wikipedia.  I even tried to reach out to Noclador and Gun Power Ma to relax and discuss things.  It is the proof in the pudding that they can not  and treat everything as a war.  Surreal.

Notability of Commonwealth Baptist College
A tag has been placed on Commonwealth Baptist College, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

I am not taking advice from either of you.  This is a conversation between me and the administrator. The only problem I see is that obnoxious and confrontational editors like Verbal are given free reign, and in the process they drive other editors off the site.  I've offered my advice:  (1) stop valuing the input of Wiki-addicts like Verbal, and start valuing the input of productive editors; (2) place a daily limit on the number of posts to discourage Wiki-addiction; and (3) ask editors not to make extensive edits to subjects they know nothing about.  Until that is done, the warring on Wikipedia will continue, and knowledgeable editors will continue to be driven off the site  and the articles will suffer.  23:03",0,0,0,0,0,0

Never do business with this bank.  It's not the real Wachovia bank anymore.  First Union, which has always been a bad bank, bought out Wachovia so that it could change its name.  First Union had a terrible reputation for incompetence and fraud, whereas Wachovia had a spotless reputation.

Think about it.  First Union was easily 100 times bigger than Wachovia.  Why would such a company abandon its brand for a virtually unknown brand name unless it was caught hurting its customers so often that its reputation was dismal?  It is just like ValueJet renaming itself after that company killed a plane load of people because they wanted to make an extra buck transporting volatile materials.

I personally lost money due to Wachovia letting my personal information be stolen.  There are tens of thousands of Wachovia bank account holders who had their personal information, including social security numbers and bank account numbers, stolen.  Do not trust this bank.

Tragedy vs. Massacre
Considering the fact that no third-party source refers to these events as a """"massacre"""" I think we need to move the title to Khojaly tragedy to avoid any POV here. Massacre is defined as: """"an indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people."""" British journalist Thomas De Waalthe one credible third-party that is heavily mentioned in article says that the tragedy in Khojaly was a result of a chaotic situation, and not a """"deliberately planned"""" action by the Armenians. Even those who wish to ascribe full blame on the Armenian/Karabakh side cannot argue that this attack was a planned event. The tragedy took place during the Battle of Khojaly. 

Helsinki Watch notes: Helsinki Watch reported that """"the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians"""". HRW states: Human Rights Watch noted that """"the attacking party [i.e., Karabakh Armenian forces] is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties.

Hey, thanks for your support.  I would like to inform you of my action plan/goals:
1) By end of tomorrow, I am going to get the Hinduism article to 60kb. For doing this, I am using the revert closest to the original FA article as a template along with the other religion pages.  It is proving to be easier than I originally thought as closer look shows a lot of repeats.
2) Then over the next few days, I plan on going thorugh every """"dodgy"""" reference and make sure it is upto the wikipedia standard.  If not, I will remove it and replace it with a valid reference.  Luckily, I have great access to lot of related scholarly articles + lot of time.  Also, I am hoping others to pitch in ofcourse.
3) I also have a long term goal based on your suggestion to round up some permanent editors for the article.  Their jobs will be to make sure stuff does not creep in + a long term goal of further improving the references.

Victorian Station Master's Academy for Wiki Editors

On Oct 14, 2005, at 3:20 AM, ANTIGRAY@cs.com wrote:

Victorian Station Masters Academy
Founded 1839

Greetings Prospective Station Masters.
This course leads to an SM Degree.

At Victorian Station Masters Academy rigorous training for a position with a great future (but anchored firmly in the past) awaits you.

We will train you to be a respected Station Master (SM) in the time-honored tradition of being an unimaginative SM who unduly emphasizes minutiae in the presentation or use of his knowledge, and can narrowly, stodgily, and often ostentatiously show how learned they are.

Our graduates learn all the basics a great Station Master must master.
You will be taught to be dull, ill-natured, and ill-humored, and narrowly inflexible in standards of conduct. The public expects this.

A Station Master must be Self Righteous, convinced of his own righteousness especially in contrast with the actions and beliefs of others and narrow-mindedly moralistic.

You will learn to be:
Hidebound, extremely old-fashioned, tedious, tiresome because of the length or dullness of your prognostications, pompously Victorian, slow in perception or sensibility, and lacking brilliance or luster.
Our graduates are renowned for having an inflexible and ultraconservative character.

We offer advanced classes in arrogance, imperiousness, and special workshops to practice irritably sullen and churlish mood and manner. 

Learn an imperious manner marked by arrogant assurance, so as to exercise arbitrary or overbearing control over and tyrannize subordinates.   
All Station Masters are taught to be MASTERFUL. When you graduate, you will have the ability to act authoritatively with an obstinate determination to enforce one's will.

Our graduates typify the moral standards, attitudes, and conduct of the age of Victoria. You will take pride in being a stuffy and hypocritical representative figure of the Victorian era.  

Applications to register for the Class of 2006 are available at all train stations during normal business hours.

""""Station Masters always know their station in life."""" 

========================
Jack,
Now you know where they get their training.

Sure, but as a physicist I really am curious how it all works in principle. I think I now understand how. Let me try to make the idea as simple as possible, without making it simpler than is possible.

Cipher of Genesis (Carlo Suares, Paris, 1973)
Pre-inflation unstable false-vacuum is pretty much like the massless vacuum Puthoff & Co are currently stuck in leading them nowhere.

Phase transition to our universe, one of an infinity, forms the giant local vacuum wave AKA Higgs field. The fabric of space-time is the FM modulation of the Goldstone Phase of this Tsunami inside the post-inflationary vacuum starting off in the hot Big Bang as per orthodox theory. The dark zero point energy comes from the AM modulation of the Higgs field and is in two universal forms one repulsive and on attractive. On the large scale ~ 73& of vacuum is repulsive, 23% attractive. We are only a tiny % of total after you subtract off the hydrogen-helium gas clouds of proto-star stuff.

Metric engineering of WWD & Wormhole is simply getting a Josephson type effect phase-lock to the macro-quantum vacuum phase.

B(x) = (hG/c^3)^1/2'd'(Vacuum Phase - Control Phase)

The local invariant scalar metric field is of the form

g(x) = (1 + B(x))(Flat Space Time)(1 + B(x)) = guv(x)dx^udx^v

WE ALWAYS get shotgun. WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you. WE are always first in line. WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you. WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off. This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY. And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT. 

No one here will ever like you. WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch. There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us. WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT. So don't try to act like you know what the fuck is going on, because you don't. You just do NOT. 

But you really think you can compete with the Review? LOL WOW Don't make me start flaming you. Are you forgetting who we are? WE are the ones who film people like you getting fucking destroyed by us. WE will rip your ASSHOLE out of your fucking rectum, STITCH IT on top of your pitiful dick hole, and then fuck you in the VAGINA we just made for you. SO WE MAKE YOU INTO A BITCH. Do you get it now?

I hope that I don't seem unfriendly or make you feel unwelcome, but I noticed your username, and I am concerned that it might not meet Wikipedia's username policy for the following reason: NO REASON GIVEN. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

I'd appreciate learning your views, for instance, your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

There are several options available to you:
 We can talk about it, here. 
 You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.
 Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.

If we can't resolve this on our own, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.      ♦ ♣ ♠ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Trivia section 

I've just removed this (again). Per WP:Trivia, there should be not be trivia sections in articles. →talk  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:TRIV#What_this_guideline_is_not

There are a number of pervasive misunderstandings about this guideline and the course of action it suggests:

 This guideline does not suggest removing trivia sections, or moving them to the talk page. - If information is otherwise suitable, it is better that it be poorly presented than not presented at all.
 This guideline does not suggest always avoiding lists in favor of prose. - Some information is better presented in a list format.
 This guideline does not suggest omitting unimportant material. - This guideline does not attempt to address the issue of what information is included or not — only how it is organized.

that is not what the above guideline seems to state. 

 Capped off His Cap in Style?? 
 
So much for NPOV there.  What is with the """"who just capped off his career in style"""" line?  Not only is that not keeping with a neutral theme, it is an update that really can't last more than a few weeks once he joins the Galaxy.

 I'd say it's factually wrong, cos he hasn't finished his career, so he hasn't """"capped his career"""" at all yet.  Removing.  If someone objects, they can put it back and give reasons why here. 
 Additional words: OK, it does say """"capped off his Real Madrid career"""" so it isn't factually wrong.  Changed line anyway to something more plain, but agree that intro should probably be reworked as it doesn't read completely encyclopaedic. 

 Lead section too long 

In my opinion, the lead section needs a serious overhaul, as it's to large and encompasses to many points that could and should be in the main article (see Wikipedia:Lead section).  (Yabba Dabba Doo!) 
The lead is ridiculous at the moment. I would have a go at cutting it down but it's best waiting until   the article is more stable. →talk  

Dave  The guidelines say the lead should be about four paragraphs, but that would be the norm.  David Beckham is not a normal article, as the subject is a major figure in current news now.  I agree wholeheartedly with your post here.  I am going to try to help make it shorter.
 

 Multiple links 
Article has multiple redundent wikilinks - link not needed for every mention of 2007 or Real Madrid for example, especially not in the same paragraph.  (Yabba Dabba Doo!) 
Sorry, you have clearly not understood that linking years when adjacent to linked date/month is not done just for the sake of wikilinking - it is required to allow all user-selected date formatting options to work, therefore I have reinstated the links.    19:22, 4 July 20",0,0,0,0,0,0

Vandal activity down since you left
Rick, it's interesting to note that since you left, vandalism on Wikipedia has gone down. It's clear that you and those like you simply act to frustrate and abuse legitimate users, whose angry responses can be classed as vandalism, giving you an increased sense of self importance. We don't need that, we need more quality editors, not more volunteer vigilantes.  
That's the biggest absurd I've ever heard. 
Indeed; it is my impression there is considerably more vandalism now. The edits of the sockuppet above would be one small example. (talk) 
Indeed.  I've blocked more in the last day than in the previous 18 months as an admin, which can only be due to the """"RickK and Heph gap"""". Complaining about RickK and Heph is like having an allergy and wishing you didn't have an immune system.   |  Talk 18:40, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non-anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise?  Pete 
If memory serves, Angela did a survey a while back (Feb or March of 2004) where she sampled the number of blocks each admin had given. Rickk had almost as many as the next 3 people combined.  19:19, July 20, 2005 (UTC)
Personally? I frequently saw his edits, and he left a useful note on my talk page correcting me for something.  

Isn't it obvious to everyone?  RickK created a whole entourage of sockpuppets, then vandalised with them, then blocked them.  Just to fulfill his self-aggrandising dreams.  He made fools of us all, just to prove that he was brilliant.  Don't you hate him?  Kill RickK, kill RickK, kill RickK'''!  

I can safely say that ever since RickK's departure, I have been faced with reverting five times the vandalism I did prior, which still dosen't come close to his legendary vandal fighting, troll combatting, and trash disposing.  
Nonsense! I wish him and his many sockpuppets stay out!  

To Raul654, now that I can believe ). Statistics on the effect of handing out bans liberally would be great to have.  Pete 

My experience in the Wikiworld has shown RickK to be abusive of other users, authoritarian, consistently reverting other peoples edits without apparent reason and unwilling to join a debate on a given subject when his arguments were confronted. Personally, Im glad he gave up.

The book is The Wolf of the Kremlin, and it was written by Stuart Kahan, an American Jew who is Kaganovich's nephew. Kahan went to the Soviet Union in 1981 and interviewed his uncle extensively  in Yiddish  to write this biography, and it is a goldmine of revelations.

To sum it up, Lazar Kaganovich was a Jew raised in the Jewish tradition, a yeshiva boy taught to guide himself on the basis of doing always what is best for the Jews, and this precept actually is cited explicitly several times in the book. He attended his first Communist Party meeting in 1911, when he was 18, to hear the Jewish communist Trotsky give a speech in a synagogue in Kiev; that's right: in a synagogue. He rose rapidly in the inner circle of the Communist Party. His success was due primarily to his aggressiveness and his ruthlessness. In his communist activity he held back from nothing, no matter how brutal or bloody. He even killed his fellow Jews when they got in his way. He was a gangster among gangsters.

In 1930 Kaganovich organized a special department of the Soviet secret police, with himself as the head. It was referred to as the department of """"wet affairs,"""" with """"wet"""" meaning """"bloody."""" That is, it handled clandestine mass executions, of the sort carried out later at Vinnitsa in Ukraine and at Katyn in Russia and at a thousand other places throughout the Soviet Union over the next two decades. Kaganovich became the commissar in charge of mass murder. Yet when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it was Kaganovich who was the savior of the Jews: he arranged for the evacuation of all Jews from the frontier areas and their resettlement far to the east, where they would be safe from the Germans. Let the Ukrainians and the Russians bear the brunt of the German invasion, but protect the Jews from hardship and danger at any cost.

When the Gentile communist Nikita Khruschev accused Kaganovich in 1957 at a Soviet Party Congress of having murdered 20 million Russians during his career, Kaganovich didn't even deny it. He only accused Khruschev of being a murderer too. """"Your hands are blood-stained too,"""" Kaganovich told him. Khruschev pointed out that the difference was that he, Khruschev, had merely followed Kaganovich's orders, while it had been Kaganovich who had formulated the policies of mass murder and had given the orders for carrying out those policies.

As I said, it's a fascinating book, this biography of Lazar Kaganovich, and if you really want to gain some insight into his mentality, you should read it for yourself. 

Kaganovich wants to boast about the power he once held, and at the same time he wants to evade responsibility for his crimes, and one can see this ambivalent attitude throughout the book.

Possibly. I've reverted the whole lot of them already (there were more than the two I first spotted), which was boring and possibly unecessary. But the problem is that in the absence of an edit summary, it's impossible for an uninvolved editor to know what is going on, so it's bound to cause problems. If the comments are to be removed, they are much better off being struck through with an explanation, which is more usual. However, as there were not multiple sock-puppet comments on any of these AfDs, I would argue that even striking through the comments is questionable. Being a sock-puppet doesn't necessarily invalidate your comment. I understand the reason for the removal, but I think it's pretty dubious practice. Thanks for the info, anyway.Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is extreme POV to say that someone's science degree is worthless. (I don't know what """"unaccredited schools"""" are - there are none in New Zealand.)
""""Acting as a scientist"""" is a very subjective notion. 
Since all non-creation scientists rely on the presumption of naturalism when dealing in """"origins"""" (non-observational) science, which is not subject to the scientific method, then essentially all non-creation scientists are not doing science. But I will allow you to continue calling them scientists.
Creation scientists with PhDs don't have to submit to mainstream dogma in order to be considered scientists; they only do that sometimes to avoid being sacked.

I went ahead and changed """"spinoffs"""" to """"versions"""" before looking at the discussion page, simply because upon reading the article, """"spinoff"""" just didn't seem appropriate. See Spin-off (media)#In video games. Spinoff typically refers to something, made later, that takes an element of the original product and expands upon it by adding new original content to it. Angel is a spinoff of Buffy, retaining the characters Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley, and the general setting of the Buffyverse, and adding several new characters, a new setting (L.A.), and a largely unrelated plot. The Sims could be considered a spinoff of Simcity, but The Sims 2 (console game) is not a spinoff of The Sims 2.  (talk|Contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0
