5355de013692dcc8,"""I believe a number of statements from this supplement to WP:OR are relevant to this discussion:
Obvious deductions are not original research.  This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.
Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only """"cervical cap"""").  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.
Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.
Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so """"cervical cap"""" is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.

I am not attached to the title of """"cervical cap"""" for this article.  I believe the best editorial decision would be to merge Lea's Shield into this article, but, like David and Una, I am open to looking for a new name.  Anon, are you willing to consider a merge with a name change?  If so, we can discuss alternatives to """"cervical barrier"""", which you have objected to. Talk     C

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

As a rule of thumb, on transferrable stations on the Seoul Subway, the information is combined into one, even for stations with different names (e.g. Isu Station, Cheonan Station).

There is also such a thing as qualitative, that is spirit of the law, rather than letter of the law that you seem to be incapable of understanding.  
As I stated, I reverted because I realized that I was in the 'Crucifixion in art' section and that my statement didn't wholly apply.  I reverted because there is important art scattered among Manga, and the movies and 30 minute toy commercials of Anime. If this had been the 'crucifixion' article I would have left my statement in.  Having said that, I will restate my objections to that particular image.  Sailor Moon, the Comic, is an important and potentially relevant piece of art.  It is the Wonder Woman of Japanese Manga;  it is liberating to girls in an otherwise oppressive culture.  Sailor Moon, the Cartoon, exists only to sell plastic make-up cases and moon wands to 8-12 year olds.  Art requires that the Artist had something to say.  If you found an identical image from the comic, and some source that said that Naoko Takeuchi had some reason for it being there, I would have little objection.   As I said, there are other actually relevant and artistic crucifixions done in Anime and Manga, and I would have no objection to those being included either.  68.114.130.234",0,0,0,0,0,0

An event in this article is a April 30 selected anniversary (may be in HTML comment)

 A question has been bugging me 
From the time the first US military advisors stepped in to Vietnam in the early 60s to the final withdrawal of all US troops in 1973 the USSR and China repeatedly warned Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon NOT to cross the DMZ and directly invade North Vietnam. That seems simple enough that we were not allowed to go in to the North BUT my question is were the South Vietnamese Forces allowed to go on the offensive and invade North Vietnam? Did USSR and China ever warn the South not to invade the North? 

Considering the U.S.'s coordination with and funding for ARVN, I'm sure that they would take South Vietnamese ground forces in North Vietnam much the same way they'd take Marines. The only """"crossing of the DMZ"""" that occurred was American bombing raids.  
Probably not, but it is doubtful that such an operation could have been pulled off.  23 July 2005
It's hard to imagine what further threats the major communist powers could have used to dissuade S.V. from doing anything. But I agree with CJK, the limited competence of the ARVN in offensive operations seems well-established in the historical record, e.g. the offensive in Laos.  (talk) 03:04, 2005 July 24 (UTC)
The forgotten factor in this little chat is the fact that the South and its dissident """"South"""" Vietnamese were often the target of U.S. bombing. Keep in mind that the terms """"North"""" and """"South"""" were circumstantial, and not actually representative of the demographic split. """"North and South"""" often simply repeats the ideological and geographic claims about the nature of the war, which American soldiers, for example, found to be not the reality: Many (perhaps most) people in the """"democratic"""" South were pro-independence, despite the Western-allied/ethnic Catholic elite. Hence any use of """"North and South"""" carries an inherent biased disparity with the facts. -|t 
I don't know what you are talking about. We were discussing whether or not the Soviets or Chinese would react if South Vietnam sent its forces to invade North Vietnam.  24 July 2005
""""I dont know what you are talking about."""" Well, it would really help if you did, wouldnt it? -|t 
Well maybe you shouldn't bring up unrelated issues in the middle of a specific discussion.  25 July 2005
I'd just like to commend the recent additions to the article.  
Actually, to my understanding, there were still many rescue raids (of captured POWs) or commando attacks that were conducted by either U.S. commandos or the """"Biet Dong Quan"""" (the ARVN equivalent) against the north during the war. It's an honour to meet celebrities like you, Trey and Parker Stone. I appreciate your criticisms to my editions on the Vietnam War page. - .
well others watching this page are quite capable of RVing Marxist language and POV it seems.  
And would RVing 'capitalist language and POV' be ok with you? -|t 
I don't know what """"capitalist language"""" means, but if it existed and was POV then I would have no problems with its reversion.  
We were actually talking about a full scale attack by South Vietnam, not a raid.  24 July 2005

Let's assume the South Vietnamese Army, without US troop support, did gather a formidable invasion force and did cross the DMZ in to the North, would the Chinese and/or USSR intervene and play the """"defending an ally card"""" for the North exactly like how we did for the South?  
I know this is a hypothetical assumption, but still, it's irrelevant, because the ARVN was never able to operate well without U.S. assistance. So answering your hypothetical, if that did happen active intervention in the form of Chinese or Soviet troops would probably not be necessary given the PAVN's superior capabilities. if we had somehow managed to make the ARVN into a capable offensive force and we were able to take over North Vietnam then yes, I'd expect the PLA (army in China) to intervene just like they had in North Korea. but American go",0,0,0,0,0,0

The idea that one can distinguish the 'thesis' and 'theory' of intelligent design is puzzling. While I don't have access to Jones' Encyclopedia of Religion, there's an entry from 2003 (listed as 'forthcoming') on Dembski's list of writings on ID. Note that this is pre-Kitzmiller, and is typical of Dembski's writings of the time - Sagan, Paley and Kant. Assuming that this is substantially similar to the final version, there's nothing about thesis vs. theory.
Beyond this, John Carter appears to misunderstand the idea of """"theory"""". There are I think perhaps several other areas of what might be called """"theoretical biology,"""" such as parts of astrobiology, which also have a total lack of any hard evidence to indicate that they even have something real to study, in that case alien life. No. That's not what theoretical biology is. Take a look at the TOC of the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Or try Acta Biotheoretica. Or even check out the journal Astrobiology. Theory isn't about """"things that lack total evidence"""". 
This entire section about 'thesis' vs. 'theory' of intelligent design appears to be based on both a misunderstanding of what Dembski was saying (pre-Kitzmiller, when he was predicting the overthrow of """"materialistic"""" science and a department of ID at a major university within a decade) and a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference of what constitutes theoretical biology, and how it differs from unfounded speculation and science fiction.

Expanding claims of mistreatment with other witnesses
29-Apr-2010: It is time to greatly expand the section about Claims of Mistreatment, to include numerous other sources. Originally, that section was quickly created to begin the topic. At first, the issue was treated as a """"he said she said"""" dispute (when there are no other witnesses than just the 2 sides making claims). However, now, there are probably 10 or 15 witnesses to add into that section, including:
 In June 2009, Knox testified they repeatedly asked, """"Did you hear Meredith scream?"""" and she replied no, no, and no. When they insisted how was that possible, she claims that she said, """"I don't know; perhaps I had my fingers in my ears."""" That became: """"Knox put her fingers in her ears when she heard Kercher screaming"""" (invented false confession).
 Knox's father attended those trial hearings and he confirmed her statements as consistent with his conversations with Amanda, for years.
 Knox's father stated that a female officer linked to hitting Knox was charged with beating another suspect.
 One of the police officers (from that night) testified that Knox was so pressured during the intense interrogation that she starting screaming (not hearsay).
 Patrik L. (Knox's boss at the pub Le Chic) stated that he was also pressured and threatened by police officers on the same day.
 Author Douglas Preston, in several reports, has stated that he was also pressured and threatened by the same prosecutor, and commented about that in relation to Knox's testimony.
All such statements are allowed, per Wikipedia policies, because they are not WP:SYN synthesis, but rather reported in single sources describing the claims of mistreatment. The current text of the section must be expanded per WP:NOTCENSORED and WP:NOTPAPER. Expect the article to exceed 200kb, when similar basic details have been added. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

ed480a9ec6e8a10b,"A classic BWilkins block, with all the familiar traits to experienced observers - brevity, arrogance and ultimately, ineffectiveness. In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass. (ab)use of oversight is logged, so it's at least good to have more names added to the list of people who've enabled this bullshit for so long anyway, it was starting to look like a one woman crusade.

Aryan Anarchism
My dear   I was wondering if you could explain your behaviour. First you remove the section on Aryan Anarchism with the comment """"(xenophobic marxism etc - not notably anarchist sorry deletinh 'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right)"""",. The section was restored with an addition to the section discussing Aryan Anarchism on the talk page inviting you to explain your somewhat bizarre comment. Bearing in mind Lala Hardayal's prominent position as an academic philosopher and Stanford University, involvement with the IWW and eventual departure from the USA following his arrest for his anarchist activities, your suggestion that the piece is not notably anarchist is hard to understand. This is compounded by your final quip """"'aryan anarchism' more advert for far-right"""". Perhaps you could explain why you regard the self-organisation of migrants against repressive immigration control? For that is certainly a feature of tehir involvement with the voyage of the Komagata Maru. Is it odd that this movement, as with every other anarchist movement, throws up contradictions. I think not! Did not Peter Kropotkin throw in his lot with Tzar and encourage Russians fight Germans as a war against the state. Was not Pierre-Joseph Proudhon a patriotic anti-communist noted for his sexist attitude to women. His anti-semitism is matched by that of the pan slavic nationalist, Bakunin. Skirting around the section on American individualist anarchism for sake of brevity lets dash to the Anarcho-capitalism, the reference to """"[[",0,0,0,0,0,0

Question: There is an image on page 14 of this DOE paper on oil shale (page 14, it takes a little while to load) that presents a schematic overview of the process. Do you think this would be a useful addition? If so, how to size it? Your reply at the article talk page would be appreciated. Sincerely,

Bringing to your notice

Someone in WP management needs to look at the Barbara Biggs entry, as it seems to my amateur eyes to be largely an advertizement of Biggs books, and a beat-up of her deeds and status based on what is written in same self-authored books. There are some references to media who interviewed her about her books/deeds but these again rested mostly on her own opinions about herself drawn from her self-authored books. Is there not supposed to be independant verification of her claims? 58.165.69.67  

 Editing survey 

Hi SandyGeorgia. My name is Mike Lyons and I am a doctoral student at Indiana University. I am conducting research on the writing and editing of high traffic “current events” articles on Wikipedia. I have noticed in the talk page archives at Barack Obama that you have contributed to the editing or maintenance of the article. I was hoping you would agree to fill out a brief survey about your experience. This study aims to help expand our thinking about collaborative knowledge production. Believe me I share your likely disdain for surveys but your participation would be immensely helpful in making the study a success. A link to the survey is included below.

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accura",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Please delete user/disc pages; warn jayron/redpen/mufka 
Hello stephen,
If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.

I requested speedy deletion on 1Apr for reason 1.6. jayron deleted it, then acted  as if s/he did me a favour. I feel jayron shouldnt have been the one to delete it initially as s/he  and I have negatively interacted in the past. Followups from jayron included an unneccesary block; followed by telling me to get a yahoo email so that I may contact wiki admins! 

Wiki is all about anon editing  as such I didnt and wont get an email account in order to communicate as it is not required.

Since then jayron,redpen, mufka have been repeatedly editing my page. I blank my page they restore it. This has been happening since April, so for 3months now.  I bet if I changed their pages they'd posting threats of  """"i'll report you"""" and/or """"you will be banned"""". It is quite easy for me to get a new ip address but I dont think Ive done anything wrong, so  I wont change my ip address. 

If my pages needed to be restored /reverted, I definitely think those three arent the ones who should do it as they/I have  a convoluted history.

If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.
If you could contact jayron, redpen, & mufka & ask that any problems they have they let an admin or arbitrator know, instread of making changes or posting to me.

It has a big natural resource in fish due to be a continental shelf larger than Greenland size. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for
eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish
(Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass
was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains
incomplete.http://www.ccamlr.org/ccamlr_science/Vol-16-2009/01Duhamel-Hautecoeur.pdf

The continental shelf teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' abyssal plain. The pelagic (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone, and the benthic (sea floor) province of the shelf is the sublittoral zone.Pinet 316-17, 418-19.
Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and hydrocarbon extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the Convention on the Continental Shelf drawn up by the UN's International Law Commission in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

France extend its jurisdiction over 567 732 square kilometers of the neighboring continental shelf from the land area of 7 215 resulting in 574 947 square kilometers. There are besides some fishing boats and vessels, owned by fishermen on Réunion Island, a department of France approximately 3,300 km (2,100 miles) to the north, who are licensed to fish within the archipelago's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Govern of France principal activities on the Kerguelen Islands focus mostly on scientific research, earth sciences and biology. 
The so-called Kerguelen microcontinent or Kerguelen Plateau include charcoal and conglomerate fragments of gneiss indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level an covered by dense conifer forest.  Tt sanks 20 million years ago and is now  below sea level. It has sedimentary rocks similar to the ones found in Australia and India, suggesting it was gondwanan origen.

Since 1992, the French Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) has operated a satellite and rocket tracking station which is located four kilometers east of Port-aux-Français. There was a need for a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, rather than in a populated, foreign place like Australia or New Zealand.""""

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY
&
Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.
Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. 

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.

1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.

1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.

In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.

Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hi, Pompous Ass!  ;) 

I know you think you're some kind of poker authority on Wikipedia, and that it's somehow your perogative to give the Imperial final thumbs up or thumbs down on what's acceptable regarding anything to do with poker here, but guess what? That's not the case. You are one of MANY arrogant, conceited, self-absorbed losers that populate Wikipedia who use this site as some sort of self-esteem builder, because here you can act like a """"big man"""", and make unilateral decisions on what's acceptable or unacceptable here.

The edits I have made (and will continue to make) on the Jack Straus entry regarding his death doesn't violate policy in ANY way. If I had the time or the inclination, I could spend several months quoting entries and instances on Wikipedia where editorial verbiage is used. You are simply a pompous ass who thinks you are the gatekeeper of anything poker-related on Wikipedia. You are not, and you will not censor me. And as I'm sure you've already realized, my ISP address constantly changes, so you won’t be able to block me, either.

fb85c9434fac2777,"This is the lead as it currently reads: Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson, September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist and triathlete. He won the Tour de France seven consecutive times (1999-2005) but was stripped of those titles by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and banned from cycling in 2012.

We have basically two things to consider: whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis. I'd say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1) there is now a consensus in the world at large that Armstrong did not properly win the Tour de France ever and since 2), as far as official racing he is concerned, he did not win the Tour de France at all. It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.",0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a difference between Pink Floyd the band (which this page is about) and Pink Floyd the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, Roger Waters has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, Roger Waters has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, Pink Floyd does not need permission from Roger Waters to release albums such as Pulse. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list """"The estate of Richard Wright"""" as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with Radiopathy that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on Wikipedia for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a Wikipedia page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as """"members"""" and not """"former members"""". I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as """"former members"""". Perhaps a good comparison would be the band Genesis. On their page only Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and and Mike Rutherford are listed, even though Peter Gabriel still own rights to aspects of the band like Roger Waters does to Pink Floyd. Also, INXS does not list Michael Hutchence as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters, but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased. Proper form would dictate that neither of these persons should be listed.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not. So its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when I criticise Blixx and co I get punished. One rule for one and one rule for another eh?

Hi sorry if the removal was a problem it's that this is a childs programme which offered no gay suggestion and was sexless in so far as apart from friendships between the characters there was no hint as to sexuality. indeed they are supposed to be children themselves and to suggest sexuality is treading on thin ice.
1/ To quote a letter as a source is poor at best, i could write an outrageous letter myself and quote it here but it wouldn't make it right.

2/ This has been denied and moreover was a misunderstanding by the press who blew 'what if' questions out of all proportion. see link please http://www.salon.com/news/1999/02/13newsb.html

2 and a half... I find the notion that a mention of a tea cup storm made by small minded individuals should be included in a pen picture of a childrens TV show ludicrous at best but this comment is the only just comment with real founding.

3/ The outcome should be entered as i find it hard to believe it ever got to a courtroom.

1/ [edit] Tinky-Winky controversy
One of the Teletubbies, Tinky Winky, was the focus of a still hinted-at controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks much like a woman's purse (although he was first """"outed"""" by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter of July 1997 to The Face).

2/ A February, 1999 article in the National Liberty Journal, published by Jerry Falwell, warned parents that Tinky could be a hidden homosexual symbol, saying """"he is purple—the gay pride color, and his antenna is shaped like a triangle—the gay pride symbol.""""

2(and a half!) A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., who licenses the characters in the United States, said it was just a magic bag. """"The fact that he carries a magic bag doesn't make him gay. It's a children's show, folks. To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children's show is kind of outlandish.""""

3/ In an incident reported in 2000, a girl's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said """"I got a gun"""". Kenn Viselman, then chairman of the Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., claimed the toy acutally said """"Again, Again"""". [3]

Can this section be removed on the grounds that it really has no worth and is trying to portray child characters as gay. Especially while using hinted and possibly.

You are spot on Leladax. Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia.

While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use """"Republic of Macedonia""""... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing.  Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name).

What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms,  why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's  recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.)

Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use

FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as """"Republic of Macedonia"""" even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states

""""the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe)

Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory

Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:.

""""Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other.

If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so.

The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) 

There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek.  

Top ranked FYROM websites  almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek  (quote taken from the website)
""""Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.""""

Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar  and uses it as """"proof"""" of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership...

'""""We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.""""' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President)

'""""We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great. We are a Slav people and our language is closely related to Bulgarian...

Well I might consider and then might even agree with you that perhaps one could point me to WP:DBAD (here spelled in a form of euphemism for my potential benefit -) ), as I consider you had pointed me (  ;-)  ), but that still hasn't given any solutions to the disagreement which goes on the talk page (here I mean the Talk:International recognition of Kosovo page). As far as the WP:RM (if this is what you had in mind) is concerned, my opinion is that the third conversator  thinks other of the procedure (I'm still not sure that there is one). Moreover, I'm certain that for the time being he doesn't think of another POV of the """"procedure"""", because of this words of his, which are somehow unclear (at least to me): """"Any new proposals will be speedy closed. Persistence will be dealt with sanctions as per the WP:ARBMAC probation this article is under the scope of."""" concerning the closure of """"proposal"""". I'm not sure if he meant new proposals through the talk page of International recognition of Kosovo (""""IroK"""") or through the WP:RM. Actually, I find WP:RM somehow vague on the sequence of steps to be taken when new request/proposal is to be made. I've tried to follow the procedure proposed as it is given at WP:RM, but then I might misunderstood something. I might consider asking for explanation on the very own project's page, as for that matter. Hus, as a formalist as I consider you at the moment, I must ask you now this: when you wrote all controversial move proposals must go through... in order to have any validity you actully wanted to write all controversial move proposals should go through...in order to have any validity. I suppose I pointed out ( one might consider I've used irony, I apologize to those) to the ambiguity of interpretation of the potential procedure, since the very procedure hasn't been tagged as a guideline, but still named a project, to the least. Maybe, some other place exists, which I'm not aware of - I apologize in advance for me being somewhat a whiner, since I've been passive and not searching for potential one myself. Not to mention judgemental and still non-constructive enough, to contribute myself (although recognition of the problem might be considered as form of contiributing action -? -/ ). Sorry for that.
Ijanderson977, you asked: Why are you not claiming that this article has a POV title: International recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia? Well, actually, I do consider this title is biased also. But personally I consider the """"IroK"""" more globally important, not just to me, as one might think it is. If the bias is dealt with this issue (IroK title), it could be dealt elsewhere also. And IMHO it is good to keep the discussion in one place -> maybe creating a new page, where this discussion concerning the term """"recognition"""" (or more) could be taken, should be considered as an idea.

FGR#11 is interesting and gives some insight into how this bureaucratic world functions. A couple of things I noted. The table of p28 shows a good dozen elements (including Ca) where the values changes by well over and order of magnitude from on """"model"""" to the next. The following summary on p29  says: """"for about 70% of radionuclides, the differences are not substantial, ie., less than a factor of four. 

That points out that none of these figures are derived from actual physical measurements but from computer models. Also there is no qualification on the uncertainty of these values as one would expect if it was a scientific test (which it is not , it's a model) . The magnitude of the changes and that fact that a factor of 4 is seen as """"not substantial"""" gives an idea of how reliable the number may or may not be.

I have found this """"Banana Equivalent Dose"""" very useful in attempting to
explain  infinitesmal doses (and corresponding infinitesmal risks) to members

critisize us for using such a deceptive concept.)

Considering the fact that the DOE has officially stated that """"there is no safe

Disclaimer:

Neither Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the University of California,
nor the Department of Energy recommends eating bananas.

So it seems the advocates of this BED idea do regard it as a bit of an insider joke, and take joy in using it to be provocative.

I had added information to the Snopes article that I not only verified but then provided information on the talk page on how to do so. Instead of checking the talk page though, lazy idiot just hits revert and goes back to eating chips off his/her chest.

Thanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn't immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I've bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. 

While there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn't show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia's title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.

Also I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states 

""""The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names""""  (i.e. not """"must"""" be) 

It further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...

Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).

Unless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as """"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place""""... I don't believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...

Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Notice the words """"and should be used in articles with caution"""". I think it's pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)

I think perhaps you've misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn't whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)
  
I'm sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I'd even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)

I am a Chinese contributor to this site and I speak 3 Chinese vernaculars and 3 European languages and through some of the unreasonable Mandarinization imposed here, I feel how repressed non-native Mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes. Thank you for being so interested in Chinese culture. We need more friends like you. Have a nice day.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 All positive points, no negatives mentioned AT ALL... 

This article reads more like a propaganda page than impartial information. It is probably written and maintained by a member of staff at the school, but even so it should give a neutral point of view. For example, the old fashioned grammar school attitudes that the school desperately hangs on to (these include uniforms that haven't changed at all since the 1950's, authoritarian attitudes that are concerned by uniform more than actually making sure the children get a good education, etc, etc...) cause tension between students and teachers, as these obviously dubious values do not fit well into modern society. Just to add to this, the most recent ofstead report strongly emphasises the need for student and teacher relationships to improve. however, because of the senior staff all living in the 1930's, they took this to mean they need to enforce the rules more, with stronger emphasis on uniform and weaker emphasis on educational support; this has simply degraded student's relationships with their teachers (especially the so - called """"senior staff"""" who don't even teach but instead spend their time punishing people for petty things - the school even employs a certain member of staff whose job it is to be horrible - ironically she is actually called Mrs Horride!) even further.

Your recent edit at Sarahs talk page 
You recently made a comment on Sarah777's talkpage which was quite strong in content. If this comment was not being addressed to Sarah, but to the IP contributor who preceeded you on the page, then it should have been made on the IP's talkpage. You should only address Sarah on Sarah's page. If, OTOH, you were addressing your remarks to sarah then you were way out of line. Either way I think you owe Sarah an apology. I also thing you should revert your edit and place it on the IPs talk page.   

It is quite obvious that i'm addressing it to the IP as Sarah never made a threat. It is hardly way out of line seeing as the IP was making what could be easily regarded as combative threat. Also its a talk page, but if you insist i shall remove the message to their talk page. An apology? I remember the last time i asked you for an apology.  (talk) 

I'm actually thinking of reverting my removal of the message as the IP's address is not static and each time they appear, their IP will be different.  (talk) 
The IPs threat is as hollow as his/her head. I wouldn't pay much attention to it.   
No need to personally attack them with the hollow comment. A threat by an Irishman (republican or loyalist) should never be taken as hollow lol.  (talk) 

I never made a threat , mabuska , so stop crying . GoodDay , my head is far from hollow, I have a static IP ,so how do I do it? please explain and personal remarks are not allowed please apologise .Back to mabuska. Never met a loyalist who is Irish , not once , did you ? """"could be easily regarded as combative threat."""" If I did make a threat you would have no problems reading it , even as like myself english is not your first tongue . Now there are going to be some issues over how I do bussiness on here , I understand that , and I DO NOT apologise for them .Now any questions? This is going to be fun .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.78.243.56   

If you want to be a disruptive, arguementative, combative editor, go ahead. Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband IP's are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different IP every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.

Anyways who said i was a loyalist? Never said i was and will state quite clearly for you that i am not one. If i was i'd had no shame in declaring that i am.

You show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was James Craig, someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. Edward Carson himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the Troubles was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history. 

If you really want to make a difference on Wikipedia and be somewhat successful at doing so the best way is to play by Wikipedias rules and not by being disruptive or coming out with childish remarks such as """"stop crying"""" or implying threats.  (talk) 

Never called you a loyalist -where did you get that from I dont makes assumptions , asked you a question , you failed to answer - the men you mention are no longer and by definition you could not meet them Ireland is a sovereign state and that was my point even the loyalist I know are not Irish citizens which is what Irish is defined as , never implied a threat stop crying lol , Wikipedia has to obey wider rules than its own , I have no lack of knowledge , how do editors get block by not going by the rules -I havent broken any nor will I , now if you dont mind I have some work to do , now apologise to me for FALSELY saying I threatened you .""",0,0,0,0,0,0

In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things.  But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the people

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",0,0,0,0,0,0

 No association between """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""" and """"Bell Labs""""? 

Earlier on this page,  had enquired:

Name origin
Wasn't the parent company (and hence weren't the labs) named after Alexander Graham Bell?  No mention of him can I find here. Carrionluggage 

Today User:BilCat deleted a recent section addition to the article titled """"Early namesake"""" in its entirety, which chronicled the """"Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory"""", also known as the Volta Laboratory (which A.G. Bell created after he won the Volta Prize). The deleted section was titled 'Early namesake' for the reason that there was an association by name as follows:
 1876 –A.G. Bell receives master phone patent, becomes part owner of the Bell Telephone Company, later renamed American Bell Telephone Company;
 1880 –A.G. Bell creates the Volta Laboratory, a.k.a. the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, for research into sound recording and transmission, including the photophone; also
 1880 –""""the management of American Bell created what would become AT&T; Long Lines."""" A.G. Bell still owns shares in ABTC, and hence thus is part owner of AT&T;  he remains """"Chief Electrician"""" of ABTC and its children for several years;
 1881 –Western Union withdrew from the telephone market and allowed Bell Telephone to acquire its telephone manufacturing arm Western Electric;
 1885  –The long lines project """"was formally incorporated into a separate company named American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T;)"""";
 1899  –""""the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell""""  (that would appear to be a friendly takeover of the parent corporation by the child);
 1925 –Bell Labs is created, and assumes the research roles conducted by Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of AT&T;'s engineering department.

Whether any research projects were passed from the Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory to the Western Electric Research Laboratories or AT&T; Engineering, and then onto the newly created Bell Labs is moot, since the section was entitled Early namesake and never inferred that there was such a connection. That there was a connection by name and share ownership, as shown above, is obvious; therefore the deleted section has now been reinstated as pertinent to the Bell Labs article.  Comments?

Many thinks the same, I won't deny that. But you have failed to mention that he is who we call as 'Bapak Pembangunan' or 'the Father of Development'. During the reign of Soekarno, whose deed perhaps stopped at the proclamation on August 17th 1945 and the short time following when MPR and DPR are established, Indonesia are on the verge of being turned into a communist nation, and people are on the worst of poverty due to the minimum development and import-export. When Soeharto was the president, Indonesia was at its best of conditionschools are openened everywhere, the 9-year-education program are legitimated, etc. It would be too much to mention all of them. He ruled with military force, correct, but I personally think it was pretty much needed to keep things in order, and would be the right thing to do had not he overdid it.

And about Soekarno etc cooperating with Japan, it wasn't completely true. During their time in Indonesia, Japanese banned all national organization and established 'Putera' which aim was to have the educated people of Indonesia to work for Japan. Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, and few others joined in 'Putera' just so they could gain information about Japanese and have supplies from them. This is also so the Japanese wouldn't keep their eyes on them while they secretly establish the national movement. There are also controverisal/underground organizations established by Indonesian icons that worked secretly amongst the villagers.

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",0,0,1,0,0,0

287b13cfeb895d86,"Redistributional Effects of Monetary Policy

Inflation targeting is not a neutral pareto improvement.  Any choice of target
redistributes from some groups to others - making some worse off.
For example, high inflation harms holders of fixed rate debt - including
pensioneers, holders of fixed income securities, employees with protected
jobs and annuity-like compensation (including most government employees,
and policy makers, and most tenured academics), and creditors.  It benefits
net debtors - particularly if they have fixed rate debt or debt with interest
rate caps.  It also benefits owners of commodities, real estate, foreign currencies,
equity in export oriented firms, local employees in trade sensitive and
offshoring-capable sectors, and the unemployed.  Low inflation benefits
holders of fixed rate debt, business that export to the target country,
importers, employees who gain from offshoring, retired people on fixed pensions
and people with protected annuity like wages (academics, government employees,
and policy makers).  Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers -
increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets,
and transfers wealth away from debtors, owners of real estate,
owners of commodities, local import sensitive businesses, and the insecurely employed.

In theory, this could be corrected - restoring its neutrality (and Pareto improvement),
however transaction costs, moral hazard, information asymmetry and political 
resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical.

To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer
of wealth between a priori known counterparties, it is not a neutral economic tool 
and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies.

Furthermore, such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy
targets - rentiers/creditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy, 
debtors will prefer looser monetary policy, as will exporters and other participants
in (internationally)tradeable sectors of the economy, owners of commodities  
and real estate, and the precariously employed

If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency
impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within
and between trading nations, some monetary policy targets may also move
an economy away from an efficient frontier.

Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents 

From a principal agent perspective, monetary policy makers face 
a personal moral hazard - since their compensation typically takes the
form of a secure fixed annuity.  This would incentivize them to favor
tight monetary policy - even at the expense of lower real GDP growth.
Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related
to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly
loose monetary policy.  Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth

 Naming convention 

I would like to resurrect my previous idea to change the current naming convention for elections. The current convention is:

Use the format """"Demonym type election, date"""", for example """"Canadian federal election, 1867""""...  (WP:NAME#Elections}

I propose this is changed to allow two alternatives, as follows:

Use either this form: political division type election, date, or this form: political division election of date. For example, Canadian federal election, 1867 or Canadian federal election of 1867.  Where an article has been created using one form, do not move the article to the other form.

This new option would make linking more natural and make the article names more encyclopedic.

Not among casual fans. Casual fans first think of the animated series, which focused on her flying and strength. Only the hardcore fans even knew about the absorption thing before the first film. Well, you have to admit, Hugh Jackman and the Wolverine character are much easier to sell to audiences than any of the other characters are/were. That's why we got a Wolverine movie and not a Cyclops movie, or a Rogue movie, or a Storm movie...or anyone else for that matter. 

Yeah, according to McG, J. Nolan wrote like the entire third act and he was pissed that the WGA didn't give him writing credit for it. 

Well, as they appear in more episodes I was being forced to realize that they are not """"recurring guests"""". Since the companions are seeing fit to include some real world info on them it was either create 4 new sections and develop them in the style of Oliver Queen...or, create a new page for all of them to exist and trim Oliver's section down to something like Clark's section and then create sections for the others that mirror that setup as well. The thing with Martha and Jonathan is that they aren't going to get any bigger. We still have season 9 ahead of his, and potentially season 10, which means potentially more appearances from these members as well as new ones. The only problem I forsee is that they have not greenlit a season 8 companion yet, because sales on season 7 weren't that great. But, as far as these specific characters go I should be just fine. I have a whole section in season 6 companion on their costumes (which I can probably scan that image and overlay it with their traditional comic book representations for a new gallery image). I also have some stuff about Alaina's costume as Black Canary. I really only need to find some reception stuff and it should be fine.   (Contact me) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

And with no hint of irony at all from him, he accused you of trying to demean and patronise him, even though that's basically how he treats anyone on Wikipedia he doesn't agree with.

After several hours work on the Dylan track at Regent Sound, pianist Phil Coulter went home and Scott called a break.  'The number wasn't going down', Scott remembers. 'Van wasn't sure. Then the guys said he didn't fancy it and thought it was cheap because I'd tried to go after the 'Here Comes The Night' tempo.' Scott reconsidered and after picking up a blues riff, a new arrangement emerged, apparently with added piano work from Peter Bardens. Engineer Bill Farley modulated the sound and Morrison provided one of his most expressive vocals."""" pp. 137-138 Rogan, Van Morrison: No Surrender.

Mistake in vandalism reversal

I reverse the changes also added to the article by the unsigned individual. There is some content here that might be worth retaining and incorporating into the article. 
However, 
 the same individual also removed my comments from the talk page. This amounts to censorship and suggests at minimum bad faith in regard to the wikipedia process of revising articles.
 the new content was a quick cut and paste from some previous text as shown by the fact the section left its original references at the end and a """"summary"""". As I noted above not all this new material is inappropriate.

 Genre and their sources 

I don't think putting genres based on a single guy's review is not so fair and so solid. Because even Billboard puts albums like Pure Heroine in Top Rock Albums list. Yeah. An album can contain guitars and not-pop vocals but it doesn't make it a rock albums I think. Above all when they have heavy synth or hip-hop/trip hop (like Born to Die) elements And Dream pop? Source says """"Building on her signature dream pop sound..."""". It's not like it directly says """"Her album's genre is Dream pop."""" It's more like talking about Born to Die and she's building some stuff on it. Yes it's better than labeling it Pop (as if Lana is freaking a Madonna or something) but I don't know...

The source does not claim Brazilian Gauchos are descended from people from the city of Laguna. It only says """"people from Laguna organized the creation and trade in livestock"""". Moreover, Darcy Ribeiro claim that """"The Brazilian Gauchos have a common historical formation with the other Gauchos from the Plate. They arise from the ethnic transformation of the mixed-race people of mixed Spanish and Portuguese men with Guarani women"""".

The population from Southwest Rio Grande do Sul is largely connect to the old population from Argentina and Uruguay, before the mass European immigration in the late 19th century that actually changed most of the ethnic formation of Argentina and Uruguay. Since Southwest Rio Grande was not affected by the more recent European immigration, the population there still has the same Portuguese/Spanish/Guarani origin of the Gauchos from La Plata Basin.

This is a message to Beam,

What the fuck do you think this is, some place where you can just waltz in unannounced and be received with arms wide open? WELL FUCK THAT! This is motherfucking Wikipedia, bitch. WE call the shots. WE ALWAYS get shotgun. WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you. WE are always first in line. WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you. WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off. This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY. And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT. 

No one here will ever like you. WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch. There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us. WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT. So don't try to act like you know what the fuck is going on, because you don't. You just do NOT. 

But you really think you can compete with the Review? LOL WOW Don't make me start flaming you. Are you forgetting who we are? WE are the ones who film people like you getting fucking destroyed by us. WE will rip your ASSHOLE out of your fucking rectum, STITCH IT on top of your pitiful dick hole, and then fuck you in the VAGINA we just made for you. SO WE MAKE YOU INTO A BITCH. Do you get it now?

Hello,

there was no Ugodski-Zavod raion in tsarist era, I was wrong, sorry. The tsarist-era raion was
of larger scale than later soviet-era raion. 
- therefore is right: """"born in ...Maloyaroslavets raion"""".

Does anyone know when the place (PGT) UGODSKI ZAVOD was renamed """"ZHUKOVO"""" in Georgi K. Zhukov's honor ?

The article literally claims: """"(...) her first article in the Dutch daily newspaper NRC Handelsblad,"""" which is simply untrue. She had already published more articles in NRC Handelsblad as well as in other Dutch newspapers.

Working as national expert is different than being an employee of the European Commission.

Well, Mees has published five articles or so in The Financial Times Deutschland, one in the English Financial Times, and five or so in Foreign Policy, plus the ones in Le Monde, New York Times et cetera. Even the Dutch article for Heleen Mees finds Mees publications in foreign papers worthwhile to mention. The article is quite unbalanced if you leave that out, while at the same time you trip over all descriptions of Mees views on women's issues.

I think there are racist admins on Wikipedia who use their position to push an agenda regarding Israel/Palestine, and our mechanisms of admin accountability are inadequate. I think there is cultural bias affecting our treatment of these topics, and our principles to monitor cultural bias are empty promises (i.e., bullshit).

It was encouraged at the time to simply find articles that you thought were """"good"""", and slap the article with it (as you put it) to get the idea up and running. The instructions at the time simply read """"The process by which articles are designated as 'good' should be much simpler and quicker than that by which articles become featured. Simply add any articles here that match the criteria, and add  to the top of the articles' talk pages."""" The criteria have been more formalized since then. I see you've only been around about a year; stick around, and you'll see lots of new projects change their criteria. All the best, –  (talk) (random) 

Deleted Riverboarding articles
Hi. Please see Robert Carlson's reply on my talk page. User_talk:Shawn_in_Montreal#Image_of_riverboarding_uploading_question. He explains that:
""""The images I would upload are of me, but not taken by me. They are souvenier photos you can buy from photo services that sell photos of your river trip as mementos. When I buy the photo I assume I get the copyright to publish as I wish. What do you think? Is there a tag category for this type of ownershipthat would satisfy Quadell?""""
I've checked the free use tags on the image upload page and I don't know what to tell him. Perhaps you could reply on the Riverboarding talk page? thanks,  

 Boerboel 

Thanks for the advice. I won't be the only one stewarding the article now, as it has been brought to the attention of several others.  (talk) 

 William Poundstone picture deletion 

hello, i am writing to inquire if someone from this profile had deleted the photo from the William Poundstone wikipedia entry. I had requested an received express permission from the author himself to use the photo of him on his wikipedia. What more authorization or documentation might I need to leave it posted on that page?   talk 

At Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission, the first paragraph states: 
To use copyrighted material on Wikipedia, it is not enough that we have permission to use it on Wikipedia alone. That's because Wikipedia itself states all its material may be used by anyone, for any purpose. So we have to be sure all material is in fact licenced for that purpose, whoever provided it.
If you read Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission, it should tell you everything you need to know. All the best, –  (talk) (random) 

okay, so i have the email requesting the author allow the picture and then i have his affirmation it is okay to post it. but now i am confused as to how to send this permissions request. i mean, it says to send it to: """"permissions-en AT wikimedia DOT org""""; but is that supposed to be an @ and a """"."""" in there and sent via my personal email or what? the language is confusing to me as this is not something with which i am familiar, but one day hope to be. i just need to be prodded in the right direction, all i want to do i assist in affixing one of my favourite author's pix to his wiki. thanks, colin  talk 07:27, 31 July",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Should be FAC, because of the election 

To be more interesting, the article should leave out the 

accusations and stay with the facts. Here’s my suggestion for 

an outline of the article:

Sarah Palin moved to Alaska with her family in 1964, when her 

parents came to teach school.

She has lived in Skagway, Eagle River and Wasilla. She 

graduated from Wasilla High School in 1982. 

She attended the University of Idaho where she received in 1987 

a bachelor of science degree in communications-journalism. 

In 1988, she married Todd Palin who she met in high school. 

They have five children – Track, Bristol, Willow, Piper and 

Trig. Track is in the Army.

Mrs. Palin was active as a sports team mom, coaching basketball 

and volunteering on the PTA to help make her kids' public 

education better.  

She served served two terms on the Wasilla City Council and two 

terms as the Mayor of Wasilla.

She served as chair of the Alaska Conservation Commission.

On December 4, 2006, she become Alaska's first woman governor.

She came to the office of Governor promising landmark ethics 

reform.

Under her leadership, Alaska implemented the Senior Benefits 

Program to provide support for low-income older Alaskans. 

Governor Palin began a $40 billion natural gas pipeline. 

She sent a large share of oil and gasoline tax revenue directly 

back to the people of Alaska and suspended the state's fuel 

tax. 

She used her veto pen to eliminate nearly a half a billion 

dollars in """"wasteful"""" spending such as the """"Bridge to Nowhere."""" 

She sold the state's luxury jet and fired the Governor's 

personal chef and driver. 

As Governor, Palin is chair of the Interstate Oil and Gas 

Compact Commission.

She also serves as chair of the Natural Resources Committee of 

the National Governors Association.

Mrs. Palin became the Republican candidate for Vice President 

of the United States in September of 2008.

 More clean up and questions 

I think the first paragraph in early childhood needs a bit of a rewrite. I propose """"Muhammad was born about the year 570[8] and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-awwal.[44] He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, part of the Quraysh tribe, and was one of Mecca's prominent families; although it appears the clan was less prosperous during Muhammad's early lifetime.[14][45] Tradition places the year of Muhammad's birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca by the Aksumite king Abraha who supplemented his army with elephants. Alternatively some 20th century scholars have suggested different years, such as 568 or 569.[47]"""". Thoughts?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not many because it would take hours. As the source is biased (and also notoriously unreliable) we shouldn't be uncritically adopting it to make statements of fact.

While I do disagree with the speedy deletion of the article, I also maintain that it would not last longer than a week on Wikipedia. The problem is that it appears to be original research: rather than an explanation of ESN based on published definitions and reviews, it builds on ideas from various sources and synthesizes them in original ways. If the article were recreated, it would quickly be nominated for deletion, and I would strongly recommend deletion for the reasons I mentioned above.

I would suggest you present the No Original Research guideline to your professor and explain that there are limits on what you can publish to Wikipedia; he should be able to find an alternate venue for you to publish your findings. I would also suggest that he read Wikipedia:School and university projects.

Qwyrxian, what's up, I have some questions for you, maybe you can help. If I find that one or a few editors are 'ganging up' on me again (on the Techno music page), trying to silence information before the public reads it ie. a request for citation (Check in the View History this week for article), is there some channel on Wikipedia to report the incidents to 'higher ups'? Are there some editors who have some over-riding power? The incidents are on the Techno page. I've added that request tag for inline citations, and the guy keeps reverting my requests, for statements that have no citation. As per our previous discussion, I think the request for citation should be allowed to stand for 2 months, to give editors time to get their sources. I don't think there is anything wrong in asking for the source, but he keeps reverting my request. Also a european added some information, and these guys keep deleting it, because it's outside of 'Detroit'. Let me know if there are any channels to raise my case to.

She explores the dynamic of maintaining her feminism, while also enjoying male, particularly black male culture, and discusses balancing feminism while also benefitting from some parts of the gendered nature of society. She asks herself questions like """"Can you be a good feminist and admit out loud that there are things that you kinda dig about patriarchy?"""" and """"Suppose you don't want to pay for your own dinner, hold the door open, fix things, move furniture, or get intimate with whatever's under the hood of a car""""?

Destructuring of the article
Ladies and gentlemen, apart from painful neutrality issue, I'm concerned with the growing deformation of the article's structure and style. I'm talking mainly about the actions of the definite national group of editors (which I could avoid naming unless it renews its usual personal attacking again).

Two weeks ago I removed the duplicating and excessicely-detailed sentences, as well as irrelevant images from """"Ukraine"""" section, and the other side seemed to agree non-images edit. Now I find new duplicating passages in the first section (although the intro looks better now). Editors who responsible for this: did you care reading section in the whole? And more, new lenghty redundant subsection on Vitebsk appeared. Not to mention the images, which litter only """"Ukraine"""" section (is this a permanent trollish attack on Ukrainian editors?).

Why doing things like that? I can understand POV-pushing intentions of pro-partisans users... But we must first of all care about innocent readers, not concerned with survival of either Russia or Ukraine. Otherwise the project would degrade, and Jimbo would run out of his budget.

Distinctively on images issue: I will put NPOV tag unless they will be removed in a week.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The """"culture"""" means that we evolve something by sharing ideas/information/solutions/knowledge/good features. Same happens in the biology. That is what I am saying. Sexual recombination (of best parents) in biology = simple communication in our knowledge sphere. We, human, have got the neural network and speech  another evolutionary mechanism, which can evolve (improve the culture) separately from biology (the genes). In the neural sphere you evolve pure ideas. You produce a better idea by combining your concepts with solutions discovered by other entities. You share the ideas for improving your culture. This is exactly what sex does in biology. I do not claim any sociobiology concept or any other disputable theory. I link undoubtful clearly related concept. But it defenitely confirmed/exploited by the bioinformatics. Saying that """"mechanisms of knowledge transfer in these two spheres have nothing in common"""" and """"relating them is obscuring"""" is unacceptable.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Other problems worth noting could be the lack of documentation surrounding active development that makes it difficult to utilize a product to its full potential.

 LOL! I am not sure anybody wants to get involved in that one. The topic banned editor [User:Andreasgde] came up with a temp. solution of avoiding the usage of """"The/the Beatles"""" midsentence and that apparently resolved most of the issue since 2011, until I stumbled into it and asked too many questions before somebody gave me some links and kicks. It would seem the hundreds of articles concerning The Beatles group, the Beatles members, albums, and compositions, use the syntax I just used.  [User:GabeMC] wants to  start changing all ocurrences to """"the Beatles"""" mid sentence with his Straw Poll. When editors disagree he gets nasty with ridicule, argumentative and posts snipes on user talk pages. His argument is that each article can ignore WP:MOSTM on it's own consensus and only war in two or three articles, so far, on this issue. Trouble is there is no consistency in trademark usage, old documents, WP:MOS vs. WP:MOSTM, English grammar, or editor ideas that prevails with capitals or not. My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read. The issue has never been resolved due to behavioural issues induced into every discussion and a lack of Arbitated Policy continues the randon edits. Even it my mentioned method succeeds think of the rogue editor seeing this, """"When all the Beatles played together The Beatles made good music."""" I am only concerned with the unaddressed behaviour of this and a few other editors in these discussions. Nobody seems to want to take them on. Some agreed that a """"shot across the bow"""" may be in order. Funny thing; all of the editors agree an arbitrated decision is needed but won't muzzle themselves long enough to draw serious attention. The mud slinging is unbeliveable and admins have told them to """"grow the fuck up"""" and other less rude demands. It would seem all five or six GabeMc supporters consistently spell Andreasegde's name incorrectly despite a dozen corrections I have witnessed. That and the behaviour technique seem too coincidental, to me. Man, I hate this stuff!

I reverted the armor section back to describing all the armors you can unlock because I think it is an interesting topic to have and because this article needs more information.

Possibly the dumbest argument I have ever heard. Are all wikipedia users fags or just you? The Wikipedia is not a gameguide retardedness doesn't even apply here. It's not telling you how to unlock the armors, just what they are. Or should we delete the characters and stories too? THOSE ARE IN GAME GUIDES!!! Fucking moron. Well, look at it now. Now it should be fine with you, right, fucking faggot?   

Take a chill pill. My mistake, perhaps it should have been no game trivia, item 6 instead. Also, your revision """"You can also unlock several armors. I would list them, but wikipedia users are total fags and think it doesn't belong in the article. Sorry."""" is in the wrong prose (1st person), doesn't really contribute to the article, violates npa and is misleading (it's guidelines that state it shouldn't be in the article), so I reverted it. Thanks! ©™ 

I don't care. Unless you remove the entire bonus features portion of the article, the armor information is related to the article.

The article on Morphological analysis started out as a relatively simple reference to Zwicky’s ideas, a definition of the process, a few references and some external links. I did not initiate this, but whoever did referred to me and the Swedish Morphological Society. This was fine with me: I went in and added a few details which I though relevant to the subject, but more or less left things as they were.

Then, a Mr. I. Tjahyo Sarwono came along with some very complicated diagrams, rather poor English, misinterpretations and explicit errors (a parameter he mistakenly calls a value, and a value he calls a parameter). I am in despair over this, as I don’t want morphological analysis to get a bad name because of a sloppy Wikipedia article. I would like to go in and give the article a major overhaul – but I don’t know what the policy is about throwing out other contributors’ texts and diagrams. Can you give me some council on this?

a7bb4bcbd7bff77a,"""I understand that a long thread like this can make you confused but, as mentioned before, the traditions were mentioned in passing as a reference to common Swedish culture today (one of the ethnicity criteria). The fact that they perhaps build on earlier pagan traditions, very likely common within the whole Germanic area, is merely interesting.

As for my source, I would still say that self identification based on research is much more legitimate than anything you can come up with. Quoting one sentence from the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Webbpage, based on some junior civil servants (webb-editors?) personal opinion, is not more legitimate than creative interpretation of a Swedish medical study (which actually does'nt support your claim).  

Selective quoting out of context in fact seems to be your speciality, regardless of the source. Besides the portion of text you quote regarding a small area of Swedish Finland, you did notice the bold text that forms the summary of the text? """"Det svenska området omfattar Nyland, Åboland, Åland och Österbotten. Området är i stora drag oförändrat sedan 1100- och 1200-talet, då högmedeltidens stora bebyggelsevåg förde svenska nybyggare till de obebodda kusttrakterna i Finland"""" (The Swedish area incompasses Nyland, Åboland, Åland och Österbotten. The area is generally unchanged since the great middle-age migration that carried Swedish settlers to the uninhabited coastal areas of Finland).

As for the paragraph on movemement that you quote a part of, it concludes with: """"Flyttning över den (språkgränsen) har förekommit i alla tider, men har blivit en företeelse i stor skala först i vår tid"""" (Movement over the language-border has taken place in all times, but has become a large scale phonomenon only in our time).

Your comparison to Ireland is interesting and in your mind perhaps even relevant. The Irish situation is however different, e.g. the English occupation actively surpressed the Irish language, culture and heritage. Something similar did not take place in Finland. In fact the Finnish language was actively developed and promoted by Finland Swedes (initially due to academic interest and in the 19th century as a bulwark against Russification).

Some things I'd like to mention. The reason Japan isn't listed as a potential superpower is because they lack the ability to project military power throughout the world, which is one of the key aspects of being a superpower. They have no nuclear arsenal, and according to their own constitution they're not allowed to use their military for anything other than defending their own country. There is far more to being a superpower than having a strong economy, but even then, their economy has been seeing stagnation as of late whereas India, China and Russia have been seeing economic growth of 8%-11% over the past few years.

As for Russia and India being failed states, that's not true either. Just look at this list. Neither country is listed. 

And perhaps you saw those other links I posted about poverty and education. Russia has far less poverty, and is far better educated than China. You grouping Russia in with India in terms of poverty and education just makes no sense at all when you look at real world statistics and real facts.

So I hope you didn't take my reverts the wrong way, but as I've shown you, your edits do not reflect """"common sense"""" as you put it, and they do not reflect the real world.

Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include university-level textbooks, books published by respected publishing houses, magazines, journals, and mainstream newspapers.

Great. Let's do that. You will notice that the """"contestant chooses door randomly and then switches"""" is both a different answer to your answer, and a different question to your question, making different assumptions. I don't want to debate which one is a better question, better assumptions, and better result. But this is an approach which is reliably sourced and which both has an informal version which is good to know and a more sophisticated version which all the smart guys (financial engineers, business school, economists) know about. Take fate into your own hands by throwing your own dice. Finesses all possible complications. You can't think when you're under the lights in the last round of the game show, that's why no-one ever switched, except for the occasional pigeon. You must think this through in advance. You must think out of the box and realize that you have TWO not one decision moments and the first is just as important as the second.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 unless you can point to a policy that says """"Major contributions"""" is inherently POV then your crusade is ignorable. The man changed economics, mathematics, computers, evolutionary biology, business, war, politics, and diplomacy with a few brief papers...several reliable sources which can and will be used to interpret his works establish that. That, with the spectre of understatement, is a major contribution to those fields and the twentieth century. Until you establish it's inherent bias and a relevant policy interpretation held by the wider consensus of Wikipedia users, you're opinion is just an opinion, and an ill-informed one.

Since Netto is a Danish store, I assume that the numbers on the Danish page are the most updated, and that the other country pages are translated from it.  | talk 

 Arson 

The Keighley store was destroyed by arson as well, in about 1998. Of course, before it burnt down baked beans were 7p. After it burnt down, they went up to 10p because they were cooked.

lol is that a joke or is it serious? if joking its funny

It is true that the Keighley store burned down, it moved out to Crossflatts while it was being rebuilt. The bean prices, though, were just a joke that were being passed around at the time.  

 Request for info review 

I've just had a look at this selection and I don't think it should belong in this article.  This is the section

The cause has not yet been identified but it is believed to have been started by a faulty heater. The fire broke out at around 4am and firefighters from around the area were called to battle the flames. The fire was not completely put out until about 12pm. It is not yet known whether the building will be demolished and rebuilt. Netto is famously associated with good value but there is a definite negative connotation linked to the supermarket chain associated with cheapness, being mainly a food shop for the lower working class. It is becoming very popular with schoolchildren who often claim that a fellow classmate shops there, as to insult the receiver (due to Netto being known for its cheapness). 

My view is that it is unescessary information and the negative connotation section is an indirect attack at Netto.  I personally have never got that impression myself or heard those connotations and they do not need to be in this article surely?   The schoolchild quote is again not needed in the article.  This is an encyclopedia not a local news paper!!
