 Disscussions with DMacks 

oth have understanding difficulty's.OneMadScientist (talk) 
I am talking about your behavior...we are all responsible for what we ourselves do, even if we feel provoked by others. It's a great test of one's strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations. Your edits were explicitly written to insult a person rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions, and you even said you were trying to undo your previous steps towards repairing the destructive atmosphere here. That's all forbidden. Period. No """"but he said..."""" or """"I'm just proving I was right all along"""". What are your personal intents for being a Wikipedia editor? If it's to improve wikipedia articles, then go do so now and stop wasting everyone's time with discussions about your previous battles. If it is anything else, including trying to school others in morality or your sense of religious obligation, no...this website it not for you. DMacks (talk) 

@DMacks WELL - I'am talking about your, and Plasmic Physics's behavior and responsibility around here and maybe this website it not for you.
You Would Do well Take your own advice DMacks. Is there not a word for describing the lack of following one's own advice (rules) which I have been condemned for using. Oh, yes now I remember, It is (hypocrite).
And I was Beginning to think you had realized YOUR errors in regards to YOUR application of YOUR """"Obligations"""" as a Wikipedia """"morality code"""" enforcer and understood my very significant and valid arguments.
Specifically for now -
In regards to YOUR choice!!(and the actual definition) of what exactly constitutes a personal attack around here. And the objectivity by which it is applied and the selective abuse of its application by YOU in particular.
You are now bringing up the very important point that I would Have Very Much desired to take up with you in your absence.
I am sorry, I mistook your silence for understanding on your behalf.
I contend that you have failed miserably in the """"great test of one's strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations"""" and should have known better given your display of """"apparent"""" authority.
I contend that (In This issue with Plasmic Physics - which you had been following from the start, at least) that after my initial """"transgressions"""" and subsequent overly profuse apologies, was being very polite and civil.
I was then was the subject of an Obvious personal attack from Plasmic Physics, who was my initial accuser!! in the very first instance (again NOT taking ones own advice!!).
His remarks which OBVIOUSLY """"were explicitly written to insult a person (me) rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions"""" and contained no factual justification.
My response contained words and statements that were correctly and appropriately describing (with civil English words) the FACTS in relation to nature of his personal attacks on me.
In my attempt to obtain an apology from him, while Lacking any support against his attack, you decided to label me the transgressor, but not him.
You appear to be very negligent and biased acting in your """"appointed role here???"""" to say the least, if not totally malicious.
I contend that your obviously biased behavior should preclude you from further involvement in any """"moral code violation"""" disciplinary action, let alone this specific one.
This is for starters in addressing your negative comments about me.
I hope I have I made this point clear to YOU now!  
OneMadScientist (talk) 
I would appreciate and DESERVE an apology from both of you but I can see that is unlikely. If not Please don't waste my time any longer with YOUR """"attempts"""" at trying justify either your or Plasma Physics transgressions toward me or bother me any longer about this issue and I SHALL LEAVE YOU ALONE and seek others here who deserve my considerate attention. It appears that you two obviously should get along well together!.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I was quite disappointed to have the changes I worked on earlier tonight stripped out and the page locked.  I wanted to include the current distress of ACORN and felt I was being careful in connecting relevant news agencies that would validate the issues.  Maybe my wording was less than ideal, but the content I wanted to convey certainly should be attributed to the current and apparently ongoing actions of ACORN.  Please reconsider and possible include the context of the issue more completely.  Thanks",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Million Dollar Championship 

WWE.com is not a reliable souce to WWE titles anymore? Are you crazy?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 187.15.89.67   
Yes but you haven't provided anything to 1)Say its a sanctioned title and 2) that its retired.Iron 
You are putting words on my mouth. 1)I never said it is a sanctioned title. I said it is unsanctioned. I just said that is recognized by WWE as a title. 2)If you see the animation on the Million Dollar Championship history page on WWE.com you will see that the title was abandoned after Ted DiBiase reign. Abandoned = retired.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 187.15.89.67   
WWE has never recognized it as a title the page even says that and just because its abandoned doesnt mean its retired.Iron 
WWE has never SANCTIONED the title! But it is RECOGNIZED! """"The Million Dollar Championship is the most extravagant and expensive championship in WWE history."""". If it takes part in WWE history it has RECOGNITION. It has an official history page (http://www.wwe.com/inside/wwefeaturepage/features/milliondollarlegacy/) and is RECOGNIZED as a title on Million Dollar Man (http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/themilliondollarman/bio/) and Ted DiBiase (http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/teddibiase/bio/) bios!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 187.15.89.67

The animation here: http://www.wwe.com/inside/wwefeaturepage/features/milliondollarlegacy/  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 187.15.89.67   
Nothing in that says its retired all it says is that he refused to take it back that's not retiring itIron 
If he refused who is using it now? Who is the current champion?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 187.15.89.67   
its vacantIron 
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!! You are funny!!!!!!!!!!!!! Vacant??????? Sorry, man, but I cannot believe that you are so retarded! The Million Dollar Man took ir back home!

OK, here we go again. To reiterate, 60's garage rock did not influence punk music. And I don't care what that long haired, anti-punk hippie Cobain was quoted as saying. You're going to depend your grunge history and contradict punk's with only ONE quote? And from a hippie who was part of a movement that helped bring punk down? That makes NO sense. I'm going to provide plenty a quote when the time comes that will vastly overshadow the quotes you have. And you godamn better not re-edit or I'll have you banned! I've done it before and I'll do it again!

By the way, I'm damn happy that idiot Cobain died. He did nothing for punk but bury it using stupid american grunge music. You lame americans don't know anything about and have no taste for style, fashion, or music.",0,0,0,0,1,0
