Well, I left for two days anyway, and I see no reason to dredge up a closed thread.  

I will say that the whole point of the thread (as Calton indicated) was to not have to get involved in it myself, and there was also really no need for an IP which displayed disruptive behavior in the past to get involved.  IPs are nice to hide behind, and I will bet money on the fact that it's been the same person all along (which is where my remarks came from).  I'm happy to admit a mistake when I make one, but this was not a mistake.  I will stand behind everything I said, based on the following line of reasoning:  a static IP is often tied to the same computer in an office (MHEC, the IP location, is not a school, it's a governing authority for the state schools in Massachusetts, so it has an office and an .edu address, but not a campus of 50 million people using a computer in the library).  The chances of two different people on the same IP (meaning at the same computer) knowing enough of Wiki internals to: go poking around ANI, try to run for ArbCom, request a block for an admin, and then have troll unblock requests (""""hello"""" is not a spurious unblock request, really?), is just too small for my liking.  I'm sorry if I'm not going to AGF that, but I cannot suspend my disbelief that far, and I got hammered for it.  

I neither expect nor require an apology, but I do want it to be known that something important was missed in that thread, and that IP's going to be a problem until someone takes care of it.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Jehovah's Witnesses Related Question 

Hi Jeffro,

I don't remember ever actually writing any Wikipedia comments before, so forgive me if my formatting ends up wonky. I was just looking for lists of Watchtower Publications to help me with my collection, when I stumbled across this page and section: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publications#Primary_study_aids

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_Watch_Tower_Society_publications#Study_aids

The heading """"These publications are intended to convert interested individuals"""" struck me as a bit jarring and out of place. For one, the immediate next header is: """"Secondary aids are considered just before or shortly after baptism"""" so it is not even consistent. Secondly, I am not sure that I agree with the talk page reason you give for keeping the header, as it includes original research (private interpretation of primary sources) and citations of a publication that might not even apply to all of the books listed, e.g., how does a 1980's Kingdom Ministry support the statement that """"Studies in the Scriptures is intended to convert interested individuals""""? Thirdly and lastly, making statements about intent is always notoriously difficult and subject to conflicting interpretation, while making statements of fact is much simpler and should be preferred.  

With that in mind, a possible alternative header might be something like:

""""These publications are generally considered prior to baptism"""" 

It is concise, clear, consistent with the other headers and doesn't make assumptions about intent, only fact. May I have your thoughts?   
(You have previously commented at Wikipedia Talk pages, and you had mastered Wiki-formatting such as indenting at the time. You also referred to yourself in the third person a few times. I hope you've recovered from that oddity.)
The intended purpose of the 'Bible study' program offered by Jehovah's Witnesses most definitely is to convert individuals to the JW faith, though the students are not told of that goal at the outset of the study. For example:
""""Your goal is to help the student achieve greater insight into the truth, qualify as an unbaptized publisher, and become a dedicated and baptized Witness of Jehovah""""—Our Kingdom Ministry, April 2001, page 5;
Chapter 18 of What Does the Bible Really Teach?, pages 174–183;
Your alternative wording would therefore be misleading, because the students don't start out with any intention of being baptised as members of the religion—they just think they're 'learning more about the Bible'. Your wording would only be suitable if the order of events was a) a person wants to be baptised as a JW; b) they study the necessary literature; c) they get baptised.  
I have added references to the article supporting the fact that the publications are used with the goal of converting individuals.

Re-considering 1st paragraph edit?
I don't understand the reasons for 's recent edit of this article  not that I'm sure that the data are necessarily """"wrong.""""  Rather, I'm persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject.  I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly """"enhanced;"""" and I also believe those changes are no improvement.  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists.
 A1. Benjamin Cardozo
 A2. Learned Hand

 B1. John Marshall Harlan
 B2. John Marshall Harlan II

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

At a minimum, I'm questioning this edit?  It deserves to be reconsidered.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The point is that the vowels in man and noun are raised in AusE according to Felicity Cox (2005), and the phonetic transcription for that IDEA example I gave you transcribes man as , and indeed it sounds like that to my ears, although that speaker did seem a bit broad.  It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.  The only reason I brought this up is because I imagine it is very noticeable to English ears (it's even noticeable to my American ears).

Let me point to the typical as I think mode of tailgaters (I only guess because I am not one) so called """"autopilot"""" when one switch off and focus only on the stop light of the car in front. This can be observed in cases when locked on to the tailgating mode, all other lanes are free to move and drive faster even within limit and surely free of obstacle of slower cars in front, but those drivers on autopilot persist and do not notice of the opportunity to change lane. Often they do tailgate for a long distance without changing lane which is free for some time and only when you decide to do so or come from behind, they come suddenly in front of you. This is partially subconscious. Our peripheral vision is sensitive to movement, their brain register this, they immediately notice that the object they notices (you) moves on or into free lane, they make immediately reactive rather than fully conscious and rational decision and they move dangerously in front of you. I believe that if they drove not on autopilot, they would long before you decided and changed lane.
I believe that such sub/un counscious behavior is a result of poor driver training. Proper training enable much better and counsious decisions and faster.

In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things.  But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

f924605dc168e5e2,"""{{unblock|
1) """"This is a continuation of conduct that got you blocked before, which is why the block length has been increased per WP:Blocking policy.""""

The length of this block was determined according to my previously having been blocked. Yet the reason I was given for that first blocking was violation of 3RR. I had NOT violated 3RR, and I have not been given ANY other reason for the blocking, so, therefore, I was wrongly blocked the first time. Even since pointing this out and having the fact acknowledged, I still have been offered no alternative explanation for why that initial block was legitimate. Having been wrongly blocked the first time, it follows that the length of time of this block is also wrongful.

2) """"Instead of reverting and telling everyone else to stop edit warring, please in future restrict yourself to discussing, say, the article content - or how Wikipedia can best be improved by neutrally reporting what reliable sources have written on the subject.""""

The assumption here is that I have not discussed article content or how Wikipedia can best be improved by neutrally reporting what reliable sources have written on the subject, which is an absolutely and demonstrably false presumption. Good faith notwithstanding, this demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the situation on the part of the blocking administrator. If you look on the Talk page, you will observe that I have been as active as any other editor in insisting that the 3rd paragraph comply with WP:NPOV, in discussion how to make this happen, in seeking to form a consensus agreement, etc.  As the assumption inherent in the reason given for the blocking being false, the blocking is therefore wrongful.

The fact is that the version of my edit was discussed at great length and voted on and approved by a majority of editors, and that it takes into account objections and concerns of others. How is it """"edit warring"""" to implement a version that has approval of a majority pending revision only after further discussion? I require an explanation. Short of that, the block should be undone.

The fact is also that the versions other editors, mostly using anonymous IP addresses, made that UNDID the version that had majority approval were done without discussion, without explanation, without seeking approval, and otherwise without making any attempt to reasonably come to an agreement on the wording, despite REPEATED requests on my part, as well as others, that they comply with Wikipedia guidelines on conflict resolution and take their objections to the Talk page for peer consideration BEFORE making edits. This is behavior that clearly does constitute edit warring. Yet the fact is also that despite attempts on my part to get administrators involved to block editors who edit the 3rd paragraph without first raising their objections and proposed solutions on the Talk page, the editors who have rejected the reasonable solution agreed on by the majority continue to have free reign to revert the version that had peer approval. It is unproductive to block editors implementing the will of the majority, who have gone out of their way to seek a solution through discussion and peer review of proposed changes, who have appealed to admins to moderate the warring, and who only make edits that have peer approval, while editors acting defiance of that agreement are allowed free reign to revert the agreed-upon wording.

According to WP:BP, the purpose and goals of blocking are fourfold:

   1. Preventing imminent or continuing damage and disruption to Wikipedia.
   2. Deterring the continuation of disruptive behavior, by making it more difficult to edit.
   3. Encouraging a rapid understanding that the present behavior cannot continue and will not be tolerated.
   4. Encouraging a more productive, congenial editing style within community norms.

1, 2: My edit did not """"damage"""" the article. It was discussed at length and had approval from a majority of editors pending revision following further discussion. It is not a """"disruption"""" to make edits implementing versions agreed upon by a majority in accordance with WP policy on conflict resolution. The disruption is 100% the responsibility of editors who revert that version without discussion, without such peer approval.

3, 4: By blocking editors who have gone out of their way to seek a reasonable solution and peer approval while editors who defy the majority decision on the 3rd paragraph are allowed free reign to continually revert the agreed version (despite requests for moderation to prevent this from occurring), the administration is discouraging, rather than encouraging, a more productive congenial editing style within community norms.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Racism, Noble savage, Orientalism and Araby 

No flaming intended, I just want balance to come to this subject.  Explain to the world, how putting Greek homosexuals on a pedestal, is in any way, shape, or form, NPOV.  You know, Greek scholars on the matter paint homosexuality in a different hue than outsiders who romanticize the subject (e.g. Oliver Stone's Alexander (film)).  They see homosexuality as existing all over the world and in all eras.  To portray Ancient Greece as some buggery paradise is prejudiced and ignorant, just as if they were all claimed to be paragons of heterosexual machismo.  Gay Greeks are your Wandering Jew.  Whenever I watched Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, homosexuality did not come to mind.  Perhaps the slash fiction community would rather Hercules and Xena """"get nasty"""" with their traveling companions, but that's beside the point.  You can't always have it to your fantasy or ideal, simply by calling other people """"narrow"""".  So far, you've succeeded in stereotyping Greeks as rabid homosexuals.  Out of all the characteristics of the Hellenic people, founders of Europe, you had to claim that their homosexuals were most importanteven iconic representations of the West.  Nobody said they were all straight either, which is something you have to admit.  Homosexual revisionism is not fact.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

your requests for info
VoluntarySlave, FrancisTyers, Aaron, I have already answered most of your questions above. I won't be caught in your mind games. I have answered your questions. Intangible has. TheIndivdualist has. Answering once is enough for any of us.

As far as the big section about Proudhon: Proudhon called himself an anarchist, agreed, but could not tell the difference between anarchy and government. So we may as well include a section on Daffy Duck and his influence on the movement.

This is an article about anarchism. Not Russian anarchism. Not European anarchism. Just anarchism. So it's not a big leap to assume that American anarchism (or the anarchism of other countries) should be included.

There is more on American anarchism that needs to be in the article. These edits are just a start.

I'll find references to show how Jesus was anti-authoritarian and revolutionary and he most certainly was. I can't account for why the revolutionary direction to his desciples was not included in the article  Jesus, I didn't write it. I can imagine why, though, LOL.

You, socialist-communists just keep dominating this article like it personally belongs to you. It doesn't. You do the same thing to, or worse, stuff that you accuse other editors of doing, and then harass them to no end. Like what you are doing to Intangible right now, which I just discovered today.

To what ends will you go to guard this aricle and keep it communistic?  How low will you people go? Please try and behave yourselves. duck talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Antelope Valley Press, colloquially referred to as the Valley Press or AV Press by its staff and Antelope Valley residents, is a daily newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Palmdale, California USA. It is the largest circulating newspaper in the area. The Valley Press covers the fast growing Antelope Valley - especially the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and adjacent areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including the upscale Los Angeles urban escapes of Acton and Agua Dulce. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance.

Other adjacent areas the Valley Press covers on an as-needed basis include the Victor Valley, Bakersfield and the southern San Joaquin Valley, and the Greater Los Angeles Area. This is especially true for aerospace related stories and local high school and college level sports.

History

The Valley Press was founded by A.J. Hicks on Saturday, April 3, 1915 as the Palmdale Post. At the time, the Valley was home to about 3,500 people. Over the decades of the 20th century, the newspaper changed hands, and there were a few name changes as well. On May 4, 1950, the paper became known as the South Antelope Valley Press.

On July 1, 1958, four men initiated a partnership between the Markham and Odett families. Arthur F. Folz was president of the board of directors in 1958, with Ralph and his brother Maurice W. Markham as vice presidents and Lamont Odett Sr. as secretary-treasurer. Ralph H. Markham bought out Maurice W. Markham, and Lamont Odett Sr. bought out Arthur F. Folz on April 1, 1961, to create the partnership of Ralph H. Markham and Lamont Odett Sr. In October 1975, Lamont Odett Sr. died and sons Bill and Monty Odett Jr. became co-publishers. On March 1, 1981, William C. Markham joined the Odetts in daily management of the paper and was elected corporate vice president and advertising director. William C. Markham became president of the board of directors after Ralph H. Markham's death in November 1985.

The Markham family became sole owners of the Antelope Valley Press in January 1994. William C. Markham is president and publisher. The William Odett family had father William and his son Lamont (""""Monty"""") Odett Sr. running the day to day operations of The Yuma Morning Sun (Now The Yuma Sun) with William's new wife Miriam as part of the team in the circa 1925 to 1935 period in Yuma, Arizona. When the Morning Sun changed ownership in 1935, the Odetts moved to the San Fernando Valley and later to Palmdale.

The paper later dropped the """"South"""" from its nameplate, and became simply the Antelope Valley Press by the early 1960s. It was a Thursday afternoon weekly until 1959 when a Sunday edition debuted. The Tuesday edition was added in 1969, followed by Friday (1982) and Wednesday (1988), Saturday (1992) and finally the Monday edition in 1998, making the Antelope Valley Press a full-fledged daily newspaper - perhaps the first Mojave Desert California based newspaper to commence daily publishing with morning delivery. The paper remains in family hands, and has never been corporately owned or had nonlocal ownership.
Technology and editorial outlook

The Valley Press was famed locally from the late 1950s for its peach-colored newsprint while under the Odett/Markham family ownership. The paper stopped using peach newsprint in 1975 due to expense and the increased use of color.

The newspaper moved into the digital age beginning in 1986 when City Editor Bill MacKenzie was given the assignment to find a publishing system. The result of that search was the installation of a Morris Publishing System network of personal computers for both classified and editorial requirements. That classified system was replaced in 1999 with Digital Technology Internal equipment. Editorial followed in 2002 to make the paper completely paginated in one system. The classified system was upgraded in early 2005 and the editorial system will be upgraded by year's end.

Your repeated copying of the entire article to Andrew Orlowski before the conclusion of that AfD is an attempt to circumvent the process, and the fact that you are doing so in bad faith, aware that what you do is wrong, is shown by your falsely flagging it each time as a """"minor edit"""" (disputed edits are never minor edits, refusing to use an edit summary, and your failure to note on either talk page that you are copying the entire contents of one article verbatim into the other.

I'm not sure where you're located or what you know about the history of the Pacific Northwest, or how much of the particular special lexicon around here you  may be aware of.  But let me tell you this, really loud and clear -= a certain warm wet southwesterly, typically days in duration, is called a Chinook by fishermen, sailors, ferry crews, loggers and yes the weathermen, who use the term as part of the loca argot in the same way they commonly use """"out on the chuck"""" meaning """"out on the water"""" (and that's not in Canadian meteorologic usages either).  The media in this case are not incorrect, but rather using the existing local tgerminology, often kinda proudly (as also with the saltchuck/chuck references); it's not the first time that standard Canadian usages are completely clueless or heedless of British Columbian usage.  It may not in fact be the same wind, there being in the old days no way to call what is now Alberta and let 'em know the tropical air mass was on its way over; all I know is the term IS part of the marine and weather lexicons in BCand, at least, in Whatcom County (where KVOS-TV 12 is, one of the stations who use the term).  As fort the directional thing, it's pretty clear with the Prairie version of the wind that the direction """"from the country ofthe Chinooks"""" IS the origin, especially when you consdier that the fur traders' HQ on the Pacific Slope was in Chinook territory (Fort Vancouver).  The directional thing on the coast is clear if you've ever seen a satellite video of a Chinook, which looks like a big thick band of white cloud streaming in from the general direction of Hawaii, but more specifically SSW even SSWxS, pretty much in a line over the Olympic Peninsula, Greater Victoria, andheadingto into Greater Vancouver from the direction of Tsawswassen, which incientally if you draw back in scale you can see is also roughly the direction of the mouth of hte Coluymbia, i.e. the coujntry of the Chinooks.  But compass-exact directions aren't hte issue, nautical ones are.  And it so happens that Chinooks arriving in Nuu-chahb-nuolth teritory would be coming from the southwest, i.e. around C ape Flattery, but nobody in those days was splitting hairs like you are; they came to use the term Chinook to mean a warm wet wind from that general direction.  The same as Squamish (wind) means a cold, harsh northerly outflow wind, which in the Georgai Strait/nortthern Puget Sound happens to be from the north and the direction of the country of the Skxwu7mesh people at what is now the town of Squamish.  Anyway, aside from all that, I've vgot requests in to Gobal, CBCand other weriters I know of hoping for a proper cite or at least a news item from the vancouver sun.  I don't care about your objections, you're just plain wrong.  And if Canadian meteorologic usage hasnt' included this term, it's their fault, not those of the BC broadcasters who still use it (""""still"""" because it dates back to the old days); it's nopt the first time that Canadian publications of any kiknd have omitted BC  perspectives or simply gotten things all wrong.  And if you ask a Chinook person, you'll find out that the correct pronunciation of the original word IS """"Tshinuk""""; the Albertan prononciation is a frenchified affectation..  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The organization of sub-topics. Culture is thrown way down towards the end, after economy and tourism, which is inappropriate. The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography, which makes it not only uninteresting, but also repetitive. Information is interspersed all through the sub-sections, without regard to whether or not they fit there. Eg, the Geography section starts with the fact that UP is the 5th largest state. That is not strictly geography, and belongs in the introduction. Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page, perhaps before toursim.

As somewhat of an aside perhaps, don't get me wrong...I fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a Jewish community should become a part of that community, adopting its minhagim as his own.

19bd0ef790ab0ae5,"""==Jared Israel's claim that he fired Gil-White from TENC==
After an email correspondance with Prof. Gil-White himself about this claim, I recieved the following response:

Dear Ryan,

In reply to your question concerning somebody's claim on my wiki page that
I was fired by Jared Israel from Emperor's Clothes, this is false. I was
never fired by Jared Israel because I was nevery in his employ. There was
never a contract that made Jared Israel my employer. My work for Emperor's
Clothes was volunteer work. Jared Israel and I had some differences and I
quit. Moreover, since I was supporting Jared Israel and Emperor's Clothes
financially, at the time, if anything it was I who employed Jared Israel. I
have the email that I sent him, in which I quit, if Wikipedia needs to see
it. But the whole thing seems rather irrelevant to me, and I doubt that
every personal dispute a person has with another person needs to be on
Wikipedia.

Best,

Francisco Gil-White

I have therefore removed all mention of such a firing, and I think it is best if the particular claims about Steven wise and the shoah, etc. be kept on the blog discussion pages they are on, as they don't seem too relevant to this biographical page.

As a further note, please keep all major edits on the discussion page before changing the bio.

I remember reading about some hominoid cryptid 12 feet tall that is supposed to roam about in Washinton D.C., so there is a small possibility that this could be a related (misspelled?) critter.

  Thank you for pointing out that the way in which I was editing was incorrect. I thought that, in order to make original research claims, these needed to be published in journals and then linked-to. I didn't realize that what I had done at the Reification (fallacy) page was advocating for the application of that properly-reviewed research to a topic to which the research was related but not directly about, which then in itself counted as an original extension (and thus, also, original research).

Dear GofW, I just saw that I was supposed to have made some changes to the entry for Fruitella. Nope.

I firmly disagree with the reasons given for reverting these 2 edits - both organisations are openly anti-Israeli (and actually quite happy to be portrayed as such). I merely pointed this out.

BTW, the gripe here is that you did a near total reversion of everything I added, on the grounds that you felt the entire edit was POV biased, without even paying attention to what I added.  And at the start of this thread, I noted that AGI in particular was removed from this article and felt it was very reasonable to add that fact back in.  As for the """"Program Costs"""" subsection that I added, yes, it needed quite a bit more work.  But it is a legitimate criticism that has been raised in other forums and not just by myself.  If you had removed that one section alone, I wouldn't be so upset about what else has transpired.  I'm glad that you've """"added back"""" some of the content I put in, but I still am not completely pleased with the tone of the article and still feel a POV bias at the moment.  I will express further objections seperately.   

 Breaking up article 

I would like to propose that all of the information about People to People International specifically be moved to a completely seperate and independent article.  Clearly PPI is more than just the Student Ambassador Program, and as this article is written there seems to be a blending and melding of the two ideas and concepts.  This article ought to be about the program itself (clearly the """"flagship"""" program of PPI).  By doing this, I think it will help this article out as well by removing the contentious issue, the relationship between PPI and AGI, and allow this article to get on with the issue of simply describing the program and who is involved.  Information such as the awards that PPI have recieved are irrelevant to describing this program, as is invoking the name of Mother Teresa in a fallacious honor by association.   

 Listing of countries visited by P2PSA groups 

This list is seemingly getting longer and longer.

Stan Winston Studios, which designed the terminators for the films, confirmed this to me via e-mail when I wrote to them asking their opinion.  Their response (direct quote): """"I'm not sure where the T-850 came from.  As far as I know, Arnold's Terminator has and always will be the T-800, model 101.  Now, the robot Terminators in T3 are T1's and Kristana Loken is the TX.  I hope that clears it up...""""  While the term """"T-850"""" is somewhat widespread on the internet, even extending to T3-related merchandise such as action figures, its origin is, to my mind, something of a mystery.  Rich

I have reverently removed my yellowing copy of the Histoire militaire from my shelves, and blown the dust off the title page.  You are right that Aubert and Pasquier are mentioned on this page, but not as its authors.  Pasquier is merely mentioned as the governor of Cochinchina at the time, and even Aubert modestly assigns the authorship to his staff officers.  During the past seven years I have made a close study of both Histoire militaire and Conquête de l'Indochine, and there are so many verbal similarities that I am convinced that Thomazi (doubtless on Aubert's état-major) was the main author of Histoire militaire, even though he is not formally credited with it.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.

However, could be a case in which """"if you have to ask"""" then maybe you can't help, or maybe you can.

I've added article to """"watch list"""" for the moment, and may try to marginally contribute. I don't pretend to understand subject with slightest depth, and would be cautious.

The larger problem is in its organization. 

A general reader wants to know, immediately, what are the potential consequences of El Nino. Instead, the article's lead grafs launch  into a long-winded and seemingly vague description of its history and theory that are more appropriate for deep into its body.

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have those links that you desire. Yes, this article is very POV based, in favour of vangard propaganda sociology. Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth.

 Conditioning? 
 Introduction
The emergence of reputation systems
How do we identify what is good? And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.

Most social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up """"distributed court of opinion.""""

Sustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.

Access has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve """"naturally"""" is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.

Filtering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an """"ingenuity gap.""""

Sheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of """"Garbage In, Garbage Out"""" applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:

""""Peter Drucker argued that """"there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."""" Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.""""
In order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to """"think smarter, not harder"""" — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be """"wired together"""" more efficiently.

Musical influences

Archuleta's mother is from Honduras, and much of the music he listened to as a child was Latin-influenced including watching his mom sing at events with her sisters.[19][21] She also """"was big on dancing"""" according to Archuleta, and would """"make"""" him dance to traditional music with his older sister.[22] He also listened to jazz music, he said, from his father's collection as well as gospel, pop, rock and """"soulful music.""""[17] In a later interview, he revealed that his father was a jazz musician. Archuleta also said he enjoys Broadway musicals.[23]

On his American Idol """"Fast Facts"""" page, Archuleta cited his musical influences as Natalie Cole, Stevie Wonder, Kirk Franklin and Bryan Adams.[18] When he listed his top pop music artists, he cited Natasha Bedingfield, Natalie Cole, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Bryan Adams, Kirk Franklin, and Robbie Williams.[18] Like Elliott Yamin and another singer he admires, John Mayer, Archuleta tries to infuse his pop selections with a soulful vibe.[17] In a Seventeen interview he cites Sara Bareilles as a clever singer-songwriter he looks up to.[24]

To Alexander.hugh.george, Yes, Archuleta is amazed with charice's voice (leave it at that and be thankful if ur a fan...) but to the point that SHE INFLUENCED his singing??? come on! I havent seen/heard any archuleta music that would prove it. ANd what? are you telling archuleta fans that HE HAS NO BALLS to just follow what others told him JUST TO PROMOTE HIS CONCERT and HIMSELF? And that DAVID, suddenly became a BIG LIAR when HE FACED an INDONESIAN MEdia last APril 2009?  

As for Regine, she never needed international exposure to be appreciated.  She had her chances but decided to just maintain a stable career in our country. Don't drag her name into this. She's a music icon in the Philippines...She already belongs in our HISTORY. SHe doesnt deserve any of these. And I dont believe that David Archuleta is so corrupt to be involved in such scheme. HE's to sweet and sincere to do that...  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

RUSHES SUNDAY
What not to ask the 2 Davids
Source: Philippine Daily Inquirer 
First Posted 22:44:00 05/16/2009

MANILA, Philippines—Media people who attended the press conference of Idols David Cook and David Archuleta were given instructions not to ask three questions.

The off-limits topics included: (1) the recent death of Cook’s brother; (2) Archuleta’s fascination for local diva Regine Velasquez; and (3) rumors concerning Archuleta’s gender.

No one dared.

pls. ALSO NOTE that DAvid mentioned Regine first before an Indonesian press (in Malaysia).

This is actually the problem that cladists think is connected to the Linnean systematization, and try to solve with cladistics. However, cladistics does not solve the problem, but only transfers it into concepts, erroneously equalizing time with space. The problem (i.e., ambiguity) is actually the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. This statement is extremely difficult to understand, although it is perfectly clear: the problem (i.e., ambiguity) is the difference between reality and our comprehension of reality. The problem to understand it may be due to that it is a difference, since a difference is unsolvable. This problem, that is, this fact, is consistently incorporated into concepts in a systematization of the Linnean kind (i.e., categories of categories). It means that the possibility for lumping and splitting is both necessary and unavoidable. An unambiguous conceptualization is simply impossible. The question whether this fact means that reality is ambiguous has to be answered with: yes. There is no way to escape this ambiguity. Mats Envall (presently at 83.254.20.53  ]

It doesn't effectively place Priestley in his historical milieu. I had to rely on other sources, such as Tapper to do that. Most of the generalized statements about Priestley's importance do not come from Schofield. I would not rely on the JP: A Comet in the System book. It is not the most reliable text we have (see publication information) and citing a dissertation is, sad to say, not the first line of defense. I already listed that Schofield quote above, which shows Priestley's indebtedness to other eighteenth-century thinkers. That list is more reliable, in my opinion. 

I agree that Schofield is partial to Priestley. It was kind of frustrating, actually, because it was the most complete account of Priestley there was.  | talk

 B Kobres concedes work of Dr. Rex Curry http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html 

B Kobres has conceded the historical discoveries of Dr. Rex Curry concerning symbolism under the horrid National Socialist German Workers' Party. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html  Even after conceding that the information could not be disputed, B Kobres nevertheless indicated his desire to suppress the information in order to maintain the intellectual errors that Kobres has mistakenly perpetuated in his past. A google post also covers the topic at

Wikilings do their dirty work anonymously, hiding behind names that do not identify them because they are ashamed to admit who they are and what they do. The practice is so widespread on wikipedia that people like Kobres have inspired and acquired the term """"wikilings"""" and """"wikiling writers"""" as a reference to their bad behavior.  B Kobres deletes valid responses to the personal attacks and kookiness of himself and other """"wikilings""""; but, B Kobres does not delete the personal attacks and kookiness of other wikilings who write with him. Kobres protects the personal attacks and kookiness of wikilings who write with him. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html  B Kobres deletes accurate information about the discoveries by Dr. Rex Curry that expose the history of Nazism in the USA.  http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  Wikilings delete anything, including even links, to accurate information. They delete accurate information that is posted on “discussion” pages, which are supposedly for discussion, but are not. Discussion pages are where wikilings insult people and then delete responses to the insults. Wikipedia is a completely untrustworthy source of information because it enables wikiling administrators to delete accurate information, but also to ban people who post accurate information, in order to prevent accurate information from being re-posted.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Challenged content

The following material has been challenged by two separate IP editors, and restored by one editor (Altenmann). Having reviewed it, it does not appear to be in an encyclopedic style and requires a rewrite. As such, I've posted it here for discussion and reworking to avoid disruption. The text in dispute is as follows:

Pincus offers managerial advice on handling difficulties caused by both types: she defines the know-it-all as the """"Truly Smart Know-It-All"""", an employee with """"a intellectual handle on the job requirements that is spectacular"""", but who """"doesn't 'see' boundaries"""", and the omniscient deity as a person who """"thinks nothing of imposing or intruding"""". Lloyd makes no such distinction, although he notes that ironically, Know-It-Alls can sometimes know what they are talking about, and simply have such a brusque style of communication that people are unwilling to listen. He characterizes Know-It-Alls as superficially domineering and controlling, but insecure underneath. The outward focus on the inferiority of their fellows is intended to mask the inner sense of their own weaknesses in knowledge, skills, and competence.
 
Pincus recommends different strategies for each type. For the case of the Truly Smart Know-It-All she observes that a manager might have to bend the rules somewhat to accommodate the negative aspects of such an employee, which include impatience, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and other peculiarities, in order to retain the positive benefits of the employee's knowledge and experience. Although she also cautions that managers have to weigh the benefits against the taxing effects, upon managers and staff, of employing an """"outlandish prima donna"""". She also recommends that rule-bending not extend to allowing the peculiarities of a true know-it-all with odd habits to be displayed to outsiders, such as customers and other visitors, and that such employees be clearly requested not to flout their eccentricities when such visitors call. She also states that managers should not be afraid of asking a genius employee questions, and should insist upon mutual respect and not adopt a self-deprecating attitude simply in order to placate such employees. Lloyd similarly advises managers to take a strong line against any form of intellectual bullying, either of others or indeed of the manager.
 
For the Know-It-All who doesn't, Pincus recommends to managers that they give praise where it is due, and that they assign such employees to work together with one, or two, other people, and regularly check for signs of stress. Notess observes that the last tactic mentioned can be unsuccessful if a Know-It-All is paired with a novice, since the Know-It-All quickly takes control away from the novice.
 
LLoyd observes that getting a point across to a Know-It-All can sometimes be difficult, and require much repetition, because such people are more interested in what they themselves are saying than in listening to others.

Please post suggestions for rewrites below; if we cannot find consensus, it might be worth seeking a third opinion or an RfC. '''chatspy """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Translation of AIDS quote
The original quote about AIDS is « Les sidaïques, en respirant du virus par tous les pores, mettent en cause l'équilibre de la nation. (…) Le sidaïque, – si vous voulez, j'emploie ce mot-là, c'est un néologisme, il est pas très beau mais je n'en connais pas d'autre –, celui-là, il faut bien le dire, est contagieux par sa transpiration, ses larmes, sa salive, son contact. C'est une espèce de lépreux, si vous voulez ». As a bilingual speaker, my translation would be more like:

""""The aids-ers, by breathing virus from every pore, put in question the balance of the nation(...). The aids-er - if you like, I use that word, it's a neologism (coining/solecism), it's not very pretty but I don't know any other-, that [person], it must be said, is contagious through his sweat, his tears, his saliva, his touch. He's somewhat like a leper, if you like.""""

He does not claim that it's a type of leprosy - 'c'est une espèce de lépreux' does literally mean '(he/she/it) is a type of leper' but is in fact a colloquial way of making an imprecise comparative. So, to summarise: he makes inaccurate statements about the means of transmission of HIV, and he compares people living with HIV to lepers/leper colonies as part of his advocacy for their forced internment.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 A great and grand success.... 

  Moment of Joy! What brought me to Wikipedia was the lack of information in the article of Meera. In mid-April 2012, after spending nearly 3 and a half months, I planned to add to those article which are seldom edited by others. Those included the Nawabs of Bengal & Murshidabad, articles related to it and soap opera articles. Soap operas are ongoing so I have to edit them daily but the article on the Nawabs is a piece of history...and I took up the work alone. Later, in May some editors helped me to fix typos and grammatical errors, but soon withdrew back their help. But, by God's grace I finished with the work today on 4 August 2012 and would love to share this success with you! My condition was same as the flying man in the pic, trying to catch a several things at the same time before it's too late. I don't know whether he succeeds or not, bu I did succeed! However, I still have to add some references and summarize the plots of soap opera articles in the soap opera articles. If you want, then you can help.

Promoting involves making subjective judgements about the facts and encouraging behavior. To include facts is not promotion, although doing so while leaving out other contradictory facts is biased, and can be considered promotional. So, the correct way to deal with pseudoscience (or any other article for that matter) is to describe the relevant, verifiable facts about the subject, whether positive or negative.

Not at all, you are making a straw man argument here. I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with.

White House circumcision petition needs signers up to and on OCT 23 https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/petition/ban-non-therapeutic-routine-infant-circumcision/2tqgSZtG Routine infant circumcision is in direct violation of human rights. It is also against the Hippocratic Oath; which states: """"Do no harm."""" Circumcision is harmful to infants and the men that they will become. A circumcision itself takes 1/3 to 1/2 of the male shaft skin on the penis. It also takes over 2000 fine touch nerve sensors, the gentle gliding mechanism that is offered by the foreskin, and the protection of the foreskin itself. It causes unnecessary pain to the infant and the anesthesia does not block all the pain that an infant feels. In 1993, a ban was formed against genital cutting of infant females. Under the law the ban should also cover male infants too as the equal protection act states. It's time for all sexes to be protected from this barbaric practice.

Second, Montreal is behind not only Paris, but also Abidjan and Lyon in population; thus if there's a """"distinction"""" of being the second most populus French-speaking city, it belongs to Abidjan (if not Kinshasa  which remains an open question).  Third, making a point about what city really is the second most populus French-speaking city is out of place in this article, although it would be useful to state why there is uncertainty about whether or not Kinshasa is a French-speaking city. In closing, it is odd that the primary language of the capital of the Deomocratic Repblic of the Congo cannot be determined in a referenceable way.  This seems to be an urgent need for this article  or, more specifically, it seems an urgent need to referencably quantify the linguistic makeup of the city.

All of this indicates that Ford utilized fragments of the GAC/LBH history to make a very different and pro-military point that the previous edit ignored. Nothing wrong with what Ford was doing in this classic film - but the previous edit stretched itself to great lengths to make parallels to Custer that do not in fact exist. I have reduced the edit to the only clear parallels that actually occur in the film.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

That is absolutely false.
You posted a """"civility warning"""" in my talk page.
That was the only time that you posted there, ever, for this issue.
My reaction to that, was to come here to ask what happened.
We discussed it here, and when the discussion ended, without any result, I removed the civility warning from my talk page, because I use to archive / remove old conversations in my talk page.
Automatically, wen you saw I had removed the civility warning, you blocked me for a 24 hour period.
Your block was absolutely illegitimate, for various reasons:
The way you did it:
The reason you gave to block me was: """"Yes, I've seen the comment on your talk page. This was the combination of mine and his responses to your previous question."""". And few minutes later, you posted """"24 hour block issued"""".
All this information was posted in your own talk page, and talking to another user.
You did not communicate to me that you had blocked me. I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.
In addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.
The reasons why you did it:
It is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.
You neither told me not to remove that stuff.
I accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.
I also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.
In all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I've explained above.
And since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.
In addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:
""""Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one's talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people's requests of justification!"""".
Where do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I """"keep"""" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: """"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again"""" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? """"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing"""" ... oh, """"we"""". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I've created. Isn't that a positive contribution?
Look: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

 I am encouraged by your feedback.  Let me clear it up a bit first: my version is written basically with Paul Graham's article on this topic in my mind.  I think that article is neither an undue appraisal nor an unfair dismissal of the term, and I think it would be a good and neutral starting point for me when I re-write the lead.
 According to that article, Web 2.0 can be boiled down into three things: democracy, Ajax, and focus on user.  This is how I structure the lead sentence: democracy (ie architecture of participation in Tim O'Reilly's words, and folksonomy in realisation) and user focus in the first part, and better UI powered with Ajax in the second.
 Specific replies as follows:
 lengthy list: agree, although the current version also features a long list as well.  Perhaps we can break down that clause into two, like this:
 ... that put emphasis on allowing users to share and collaborate information online in new ways as part of the service, presented in a user-friendly, interactive, and often Ajax-enabled, user interface.
 """"collaborate information"""": my wrong.  Let's preserve the order in the current version, ie """"collaborate and share information"""".
 folksonomy: see my point re: democracy and architecture of participation above.  I do believe that this is an important feature that distinguish Web 2.0 from the old: a platform, built-in as part of the service, that allows users to actively contribute to the grouping and ranking of contents.  You won't have that pre-Web 2.0.  Even the readers' ranking at Amazon.com was initially a secondary feature.
 cluttering the lead: please see if the revised version above would make it better presented.  And as I have mentioned above, the original version suffers from the same problem as well.
 focus on what web 2.0 is: I believe this is what I am doing with the revised version.  The current version simply mentions too much of O'Reilly Media, but the term has evolved far beyond their reach and control.  And I do believe the revised version does sufficiently address the fact that it has become a buzzword in the marketing sense.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

If I'm not mistaken, It sounds like you are telling me to piss off and go edit somewhere else. I certainly do not want to sound uncivil but don't be a Bully or a dick. Specifically which so-called unreliable source were you accusing me of using?  I have not used or added or any sources to the main entry that were not already there or that you did not restore yourself! If you say a source I used on this entry affects my credibility then you show be. Which source specifically are you referring to? Make sure you are accurate because if you are wrong WP:SPADE I will accurately call you a liar.  This is hardly constructive conversation about the entry or the subject matter it should discuss which is the actual purpose of this talk page.  

To accuse me of being a believer in this crap is offensive to me and is taken as personal attack. Now both of you doing it.  Glad I don't have to type this twice so I applies to both of you plus anyone else who wants to jump on. 
It would take a real simpleton to believe the current conspiracy but you'd be much worse off mentally if you still believed that our government plus Canada, UK, and Australia hasn't ever worked together on a series of covert projects designed to spread biological agents over a large scale (across continents) from airplanes. I hope that's not the case here.  Go ahead and call that what I just described a conspiracy. I dare you- in fact I double-dog-dare you! It is declassified and admitted and on a participating government website. I'll assume good faith, perhaps it is ignorance of the subject on your parts. It ok, I'm ignorant of a lot of wikipedia editing stuff. Belief in documented past history is the not the same as a belief in some conspiracy theory crap. Based on you comments about me, this is a concept you appear to be having trouble with. Any competent person would understand they are not the same. Is there was one available to you to explain it? I was explained to you repeatedly on this page and on my talk page. You are pretty dense of you don't have it yet.  You will find that my primary sources are 100 times more accurate than anything you'll ever find on about this fringe topic.  I am a subject matter expert on certain aspects of CBW and exposures but not on chem trails but no about to out myself to convince you.  Government declassified primary sources on WP are to be used sparingly. People like you make it difficult to talk about serious subjects. Reasonable people should not be constrained in their edits by pure ignorance unless ignorance is the consensus (TBD).  You are unable to consider ever it which speaks to your credibility. I've never seen anything like it except with the Japanese.  They never learned any thing negative about their national history in school and rarely consider that conflicting with their established beliefs. Department of National Defence (Canada), Biological Warfare Talk to me once you Understand its significance. It is 245 whole pages of you and your poor attitude being epically wrong. Tell me or tell all of us about how its not true.  Next as a recently uncovered case Associated Press. Planes covertly dropping chemicals on kids?  Want the whole report?  See the Lawsuits over it? That should get you and people like you somewhere near the truth someday but my guess is for people like you it never will...  Bad sources that don't back my viewpoint? Hardly.

Advice
To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.

Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.

It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.

The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for """"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article"""". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.

I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the """"GFDL"""" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying """"I agree to this being put in"""" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""

9bf4f6044baa6572,"""::Archont Petar and Petar Gojniković are two different people. Archont Petar was born in ca. 930. Petar Gojniković was born much earlier. Read this line from the House of Vlastimirović article: """"Knez Petar Gojniković (son of Gojnik, grandson of Vlastimir), born ca. 870, ruled 892/3-917/8, captured by Bulgarians, died in captivity. """" Those dates are nowhere close to of Archont Petar's. All I know for a fact is that Archont Petar died either during or after the 970s. So, please, don't put false facts in an article unless you do some research. Also, Archont Petar is also called Predimir and in some sources, I am finding the use of Predimir rather than Petar for Archont Petar. This should help.

It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions.

What you had done repeatedly with family names Alempijević et al. is vandalising. As per Category:Redirects_from_surnames redirect """"MAY be used"""" if there is only one person with that surname but only if s/he is well known under the surname alone. And even then it does NOT HAVE to be used. In the case of football players, they are certainly not famous enough (and neither is some minor politician being tried) to be considered an exclusive representative of the surname.

Family name is a separate entry from these individual people. Family names in various languages do have separate entries. Maybe the article about Ćesarević and Alempijević needs expounding to be a decent article on a family name, but it most certainly does not need to be vandalised with effacing it and redirecting, it is a valid entry as such.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

fb85c9434fac2777,"This is the lead as it currently reads: Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson, September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist and triathlete. He won the Tour de France seven consecutive times (1999-2005) but was stripped of those titles by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and banned from cycling in 2012.

We have basically two things to consider: whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis. I'd say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1) there is now a consensus in the world at large that Armstrong did not properly win the Tour de France ever and since 2), as far as official racing he is concerned, he did not win the Tour de France at all. It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The one dike bar on 4th ave is usually pretty dead, as is the one on 5th ave.  The point is there IS no gay community.  A few lesbians does not a community make.  But I'm not denying that lesbians call the neighborhood home.  It has been a liberal neighborhood for 30 years.  The point is, the term itself, Dyke Slope.  I don't like it.  I've never heard it.  I don't think its appropriate for Wikipedia.  And don't tell me what to do.  I can type whatever I feel like on this page.

I think you sound like a delusional, academic lesbian who wishes you had a neighborhood of your own.  I've never even denied that lesbians are found in the neighborhood.  My point is that while they have always been present, perhaps in greater numbers than elsewhere, they have had minimal impact on the neighborhood. They certainly have not been numerous enough to warrant a term like """"Dike Slope"""".  The reality is lesbianism is largely an academic phenomenon.  It doesn't surprise me in the slightest some professor would make such a claim.  But, that one class does not trump a substantial portion of my personal experience over many years.

Technically, there are two articles, but the one from 2006 relies only on the one from 1944 as its sole source, and does not indicate that the author of the 2006 did any independent research beyond finding the 1944 article on the Internet.  Generally, Wikipedia does not consider a single unverified first-person account to be sufficient, and that should be especially true when it is anonymous.

2. According to the 1944 article, there should be many, many witnesses.  After 69 years, neither the Pope, nor any of the Vatican officials there with him, nor any of the 80 or so visitors waiting has confirmed that this incident ever happened.  Some of the witnesses, especially the German soldiers, might have died before the story was first published.  However, if it was true, there should have been at least some surviving witnesses.  The lack of any independent verification makes the entire story rather doubtful.

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.

Nuclear reactor [1] or a nuclear reactor, a device for performing a set of nuclear reactions under control. The laboratory scale apparatus for the production of specific isotopes, radioactive materials (radioisotopes) Prtvdarvha as well as for medical and laboratory and industrial scale for the production of electricity are made 
History 

The first controlled nuclear fission energy was achieved in December 1942. Construction and operation of a cell led by a form of graphite bricks and uranium and uranium oxide fuel successfully concluded. The cell nuclear football at the University of Chicago was the first nuclear reactor was operating. 

 Reactor Building 

Despite the diversity of the reactors, almost all of them are composed of the same components. These components include the fuel cover fuel to slow neutrons from fission, cool stacks for transporting thermal energy from the fission process is controlled to control the fission rate. 

Fuel for nuclear reactors should be such that undergo fission neutrons can be obtained. Five Fissile Nuclides that are currently used in reactors. 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu. Some Nuclides from the thermal neutrons for fission and some fast neutrons are also produced by fission. Reactor fuel is a difference between property in Uncategorized. The ability of fission fuel used in nuclear reactors must be able to meet other needs. Fuel must be mechanically strong, chemically stable against the radiation damage resistance, so the reactor does not undergo physical and chemical changes. The thermal conductivity of the material must be high enough so that the heat can move easily. It is also possible to obtain, making a comfortable, relatively low cost and non-hazardous chemicals and other benefits in terms of fuel. 

Pod reactor 

Nuclear fuels are put directly into the reactor, but has always been used as a cover. Covered or sheathed fuel, moderator and coolant it apart. This corrosion protection and fuel the spread of fission products from irradiated fuel to the environment is prevented. The pods could also fuel support structure and heat transfer to help. Materials such as fuel pods have good thermal and mechanical properties and the chemical interaction with the fuel material is stable environment. It is sheathed with a low cross towards nuclear interactions of neutrons and is resistant against radiation. 

 Neutron moderator materials 

A substance that can slow or rapid thermal neutrons are used up. The kernel has a mass close to the mass of the neutron is slow is best. The reactor will be used for the lower neutron absorption cross-section should be. Due to the properties of slow, there are some substances that can be used. Hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and carbon are some examples moderator. Because beryllium is toxic, it is too low to be used in reactors. The isotopes of hydrogen, heavy water, and the water and carbon, in the form of graphite as a material to be used. 

Heavy water in some types of nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator is used. They can react with uranium to neutrons. Than conventional light water or water can also be used as a moderator, but because light water absorbs the thermal neutrons are light water reactors need enriched uranium to use high purity, But heavy water reactors can not enrich uranium or conventional uses heavy water so the discussion is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. Heavy water reactors can be built in a way that requires no equipment enriched uranium to make plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. However, conventional uranium for use in nuclear weapons could be used in other ways, too.This material controls. But in non-industrialized countries like America and Canada, it means much gram and kilogram quantities without any specific authorization of the manufacturers or supplier chemicals supplied. The price per kilogram of heavy water with a purity of 9899% in about 600 to 700 dollars. It also can not use enriched uranium and heavy water plutonium production reactor construction. Just as pure carbon, super slow since the Nazis use of impure carbon use, they did not notice the truth of America's first experimental nuclear reactor in 1942 and the Manhattan Project and the Trinity test of the plutonium bomb, known as «FAT MAN »the manufacture of enriched uranium or heavy water is not used. 

Cooler 

Heat from fission in the reactor or fuel must be removed from the heat too high or the fuel rods melt. Heat is the fuel in the reactor power may be used to generate electricity. Characteristics of the coolant should be directed to heat the heat transfer can be effective. Also, chemical stability and lower neutron absorption cross section of two major properties Knndhast cool. Another point that must be noted",0,0,0,0,0,0

Peer review

I've archived all the previous discussion in preperation for extensive work on this article.  Hopefully the peer review can help use on our way to FA status.  I'll add my comments about what needs to be done shortly.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

 New layout 

I think we need a better layout, and this is what I propose (based on other religous pages):

Etymology
Originating from Sanskrit (śiṣya or śikṣā) or Pali (sikkhā).
Beliefs
One god - reference to what god is in Sikh thought, reference the Mul Mantra as underlying the characteristics of God
Thoughts on birth, death, reincarnation, karma - relation to dharmic faiths and crucially how Sikhism differs
Equality of people regardless of race, religion, caste etc,
History
General climate in India at the time
The Sikh gurus; placing special emphasis on Nanak as the founder, and Gobind Singh as the founder of the Khalsa
The Guru Granth Sahib
Influences in Sikhism post-Gurus (famous Sikhs like Banda Bahadur and Ranjit Singh).  Including influence of the British, and issue in independent India.
Scripture
Guru Granth Sahib (creation of, layout and content)
Dasam Granth (and controversy)
Janam Sakhis
Other scripture
Khalsa
Sikhs
Five Ks
Punjab and punjabi culture and how it relates to Sikhism
Sikhism in the diaspora
New Sikh converts
Institutions
Places of worship (Gurdwaras)
Harimandir Sahib, Akal Takht (spirtual and temporal - duties of both)
SGPC and other gurdwara administration committees
Sects and groups
Talk about differing groups of Sikhs (including caste distinctions which still persist contrary to Sikh teachings)
Udasis, Nirankaris and others

In addition, we need to get rid of the mass of links at the bottom of the page, as well as the audio files which are not relevant on this page.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

Pictures and Table

I don't see the need in having 2 pictures of men wearing turbans. I think one of them should be replaced by a picture of one of the 5 K's or maybe even a picture of a Guru.

Also, I think the order of the columns in the table containing information about the Gurus needs to be changed. I think all dates should be read in chronological order, which means that the """"Date of Birth"""" column should come before the """"Guruship on"""" column. This to me is a more logical order.
 

Yes, I agree with your comments.  We'll incorporate your commments in the re-write.  The dates of the Gurus also need fact checking and have been flagged for some while.   | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

Okay, all done.  Please check the new picture.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

That is a much better picture, thank you! There is something I am unsure about though and I hope someone can resolve the matter. In that table about the Gurus it says that Guru Nanak received his guruship the day he was born. Is this a widely accepted belief amongst the Sikh community? I ask because I had always thought that Guru Nanak became a Guru the day he emerged from the river Bain and said """"There is neither Hindu nor Muslim..."""" and recited the Mool Mantra for the first time. I am not entirely sure though. Am I mistaken to believe this?  

It could also be viewed that as there was nobody (well, apart from God I suppose), to pass their guruship onto him, he was a guru since birth.  I believe your way of looking at it is definately better and I will change it.  By the way, feel free to edit any of the articles on Wikipedia.  There are plenty of problems on the Sikhism-related pages and none were really written by scholars.  | ਸੁਖ | Talk 

 Styles 

I'm a bit unsure how to proceed with general styling in the article.

Punjabi written in Gurmukhi does not have a complex set of consonant clusters so sometimes the inherent 'a' is dropped without it being indicated in writing.  Should we transcribe with or without the 'a'?

Re: Authoritive statements of Irving in [Battle of Britain] article.

You have re-wrote the section as following:

Historian David Irving states that part of this reason was due to the totally inadequate production levels, with 250 single-engined and 64 twin-engined fighter aircraft produced on avarage per month during early 1941Irving 1974, p. 163., and that as a result, the number of German front line aircraft were declining, and this problem would not be improved until the spring of 1942, with a huge effort to expand production, reaching 1,200 by March/April 1942.Irving 1974, p. 142.

In fact, however, Irving does not make these statements. If you read the book  (which has been linked in free pdf format), here is what he writes on page 163:
On Milch’s desk there were already the most alarming reports not only of the gathering RAF bomber strength but of bomber production in America too. To him, air defence rested primarily on the fighter squadrons, but at present the Air Staff was calling for only  fighter aircraft to be produced a month. Fighter production had averaged  single- and  twin-engined aircraft a month during . Milch and his new planning chief von Gablenz wanted far greater numbers, and with more bombers as well  not only the  He s but  Ju s of the latest type as well.⁴⁰

etc.

 Quoting emails 
Increasingly, some parties are quoting emails from the leaked archive (ex. . I thought that this was not to be done (""""No quoting of any email is to be done by persons other than the author or intended recipient(s)"""")? Am I mistaken? | talk  
I believe the intention of the provision you have quoted, is to prevent wide-scale quoting of entire emails and entire email exchanges; that is the assumption I will work off when taking affirmative action (as opposed to reactive action, such as this), although I invite you to have the Committee comment on my interpretation of it. Regardless, I'll ask Offliner to paraphrase what you wrote on the mailing list, although having him do this could be to your disadvantage as it provides him the opportunity to represent what you said on the mailing list in whatever way and with whatever language he chooses.   
Daniel, I don’t mind you removing my entire section (at your discretion) for as long as you read it, by going back to my post, and relating to the particulars listed in it. However, there’s nothing in the initial provisions of this case indicating that you’re supposed to prevent only wide-scale quoting of entire emails and email exchanges. – That is your own interpretation of the warning which needs to be confirmed by the Committee. Meanwhile, quoting of illegally accessed emails includes also explaining in ones own words what’s in those emails, which in a way is even worse, because paraphrasing other people is obviously tainted by personal agendas. Cheers,  talk 
Quoting, out-of-context and possibly doctored emails is creating, IMHO, more problems than paraphrasing, as it gives an air of legitimacy to this harassment campaign. PS. Offliner is not the ony party quoting @s, Russavia is doing that as well. | talk  
(edit conflict) I'm charged, as the Clerk of the case, to interpret the directives I receive. Until such a time as I am explicitly overruled by the Committee, how I interpret those directives is how the case will be run. I have interpreted the directives and disallowing the quoting of the contents of emails, allowing the subjects of emails, and allowing the paraphrasing of content of emails where said paraphrasing. If you're concerned about mis-paraphrasing, the other alternative is to give permission to be quoted; otherwise, your emails can and will be paraphrased within reason. If you believe a paraphrase is misleading, you are free to address it in your own evidence section.
These are the rules for the case.   
And in response to Piotrus, either allow yourself to be quoted explicitly, or refute the paraphrasing in your evidence section, or else appeal my decision to the Committee by email to arbcom-l@lists.wikimedia.org. I will be happy to have my interpretation, which is binding on the case absent a contrary directive from th",0,0,0,0,0,0

Image source problem with Image:L34419cdd0000 2 15978.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:L34419cdd0000 2 15978.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Non-free content, use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following this link. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after .

It may be deleted soon, unless we can determine the license and the source of the image. If you know this information, then you can add a copyright tag to the image description page.

I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information.

Also, NOP want a good of whole naation without looking at religion/politics beliefs and skin color. You think that NOP is anti-semitic ? Jan Mosdorf is a NOP's hero, guess what ? Mosdorf was a Jew who died in Auschwitz during the Holocaust time. Above that, NOP members never attacked any Jew during its 25 years of excisting and never calls for destroying any Synagouges in Poland. Look at the NOP's forum when its topic about destroyed Jewish tombs - read the reaction of members and stop spreading your hateress among normal and patriotic people. We are not Combat 18 or Blood&Honour;, we are Polish patriots and we will never agree with the neo-nazi actions against anything Polish, such as Polish Jews, but you will never understand this as long as you don't live in Poland.

Your substitute is not adequate, either: therefore, it is asserted by some critics that socialistic is less individualistic.  Firstly, the use of a weasel words is strongly discouraged at Wikipedia; please read WP:AWW for more information.  Secondly, socialism is less individualistic than what?

What, what?? Ooh no, I don't do FA-class – reviewers are much too awkward to deal with at that level. A-class coupled with GA are my limit. And as far as this article goes, it doesn't need improving, it needs a 100% rewrite – it has become far too sloppy and contains so much trivial stuff that the prose is terrible to read in places, events are all over the place (i.e. not very well written, chronologically speaking) and it isn't very encyclopedic any more. No wonder it was delisted and no one wants to promote it, which is a shame given that this man was a true British hero. In contrast Napoleon's page is well written, has better focus, and is clearly of a higher standard. If I were to rewrite this, I'd literally spend months starting from scratch in sandbox and simply replace the lot when done. I don't think """"leadership"""" is required, too WP:OWNish. Simply needs someone to be WP:BOLD and redo the whole page objectively, from birth to death, without all the off-side commentary that currently plagues the page. Unfortunately, I'm tied down writing an extensive article on Napoleon's entire military career, and I'm only up to 1796 after months of reading – long way to go yet.. so even if I were to consider rewriting this, it wouldn't be until sometime next year, at the earliest, once this other article has been through the process of several long-winded PR/A/GA reviews, first.

 Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist 

Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!

http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm

http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism

If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:

Camille Paglia: """"On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism."""" 

Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of """"traditional"""" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a """"respectable"""" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

Your recent edit at Sarahs talk page 
You recently made a comment on Sarah777's talkpage which was quite strong in content. If this comment was not being addressed to Sarah, but to the IP contributor who preceeded you on the page, then it should have been made on the IP's talkpage. You should only address Sarah on Sarah's page. If, OTOH, you were addressing your remarks to sarah then you were way out of line. Either way I think you owe Sarah an apology. I also thing you should revert your edit and place it on the IPs talk page.   

It is quite obvious that i'm addressing it to the IP as Sarah never made a threat. It is hardly way out of line seeing as the IP was making what could be easily regarded as combative threat. Also its a talk page, but if you insist i shall remove the message to their talk page. An apology? I remember the last time i asked you for an apology.  (talk) 

I'm actually thinking of reverting my removal of the message as the IP's address is not static and each time they appear, their IP will be different.  (talk) 
The IPs threat is as hollow as his/her head. I wouldn't pay much attention to it.   
No need to personally attack them with the hollow comment. A threat by an Irishman (republican or loyalist) should never be taken as hollow lol.  (talk) 

I never made a threat , mabuska , so stop crying . GoodDay , my head is far from hollow, I have a static IP ,so how do I do it? please explain and personal remarks are not allowed please apologise .Back to mabuska. Never met a loyalist who is Irish , not once , did you ? """"could be easily regarded as combative threat."""" If I did make a threat you would have no problems reading it , even as like myself english is not your first tongue . Now there are going to be some issues over how I do bussiness on here , I understand that , and I DO NOT apologise for them .Now any questions? This is going to be fun .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.78.243.56   

If you want to be a disruptive, arguementative, combative editor, go ahead. Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband IP's are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different IP every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.

Anyways who said i was a loyalist? Never said i was and will state quite clearly for you that i am not one. If i was i'd had no shame in declaring that i am.

You show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was James Craig, someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. Edward Carson himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the Troubles was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history. 

If you really want to make a difference on Wikipedia and be somewhat successful at doing so the best way is to play by Wikipedias rules and not by being disruptive or coming out with childish remarks such as """"stop crying"""" or implying threats.  (talk) 

Never called you a loyalist -where did you get that from I dont makes assumptions , asked you a question , you failed to answer - the men you mention are no longer and by definition you could not meet them Ireland is a sovereign state and that was my point even the loyalist I know are not Irish citizens which is what Irish is defined as , never implied a threat stop crying lol , Wikipedia has to obey wider rules than its own , I have no lack of knowledge , how do editors get block by not going by the rules -I havent broken any nor will I , now if you dont mind I have some work to do , now apologise to me for FALSELY saying I threatened you .""",0,0,0,0,0,0

RM, in that interview he identifies himself with pantheism and names Baruch Spinoza as another Jewish pantheist. A quick look on Google Books shows that he is often claimed as an atheist, as Northern heard say 1 2 3 4 5. In one 1974 work, Ben-Gurion is called a 'freethinking deist [who] had profound reverence for the Bible' 6. I've not been able to confirm his pantheism anywhere else, but a quote from the man himself should be considered more reliable, even though this may only have been his opinion at the time of the interview (1970). According to source 5, he identified as an atheist during the 1960 census, so perhaps his views changed or were fluctuant. It seems that it's hard to label him as anything, although whatever he was, it looks like he wasn't a theist and rejected traditional religious views of Judaism.   23:20, 23 July 2015",0,0,0,0,0,0

It was during a crackling summer storm in Smiljan, a small hamlet at the back edge of a plateau set high in the mountains, when Nikola Tesla was born. The Serbian family resided in the province of Lika, a plateau and gentle river valley in Croatia where wild boar and deer still dwell….
…
In the early 1800s, having been briefly part of Napoleon’s Illyrian provinces, Croatia was now a domain of Austria-Hungary. With its neighboring Slavic countries of Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Serbia, an Slovenia, Croatia was sandwiched between the ruling Hapsburg dynasty to the north and the Ottoman Empire to the south.

 My letter to NeinN 

I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales.

If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions.

It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term """"disproportionableness"""". I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other """"ism"""". That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say """"floccinaucinihilipilification"""", NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN.

Hi, Cirt - I hope you will consider stopping accusing me of bad faith editing. If you have any qualms with particular edits, I'd love to hear what is wrong with them and how my approach can be improved. 

I'd like to direct your attention to two quotes on user pages. The first is from Jimmy Wales:

== You can edit this page! ==

Really, you can! If you would like to, please feel free to do so. Make an edit – or even several! After all, that is what Wikipedia is all about.''

And the second is from Neelix's user page:

Wikipedia is thoroughly, inherently collaborative. In the humanities division of academia, we still hold to the ideal of the lone genius, expecting that each humanities scholar be the sole author of his or her journal articles. In the sciences and social sciences, we expect that there be two or three authors for each journal article. On Wikipedia, every well-developed article has many more than three authors. The result is an ever-increasingly accurate approximation of objectivity. This objectivity is not the pseudo-objectivity that results from ignoring our biases as authors, but is rather the result of diverse perspectives all being covered proportionally through discussion between people who have those diverse perspectives. We write better when we write together.

I think those principles are pretty neat. And I am certain my editing adheres to them. If you'd like to contact me off the site, let me know - I'd be happy to share ways to get in touch.",0,0,0,0,0,0

To the best of my knowledge, Scarlett Heights is a semester school  
http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/schools/schools/docs/semesteredschools.pdf
 along with Silverthorn, Thistletown and North Albion.  Weston is not really in the region.   The article implies that students from as far as Rexdale come to Kipling because of its semestered nature.  However, such students would have several closer alternatives.  Something else must be attracting such students.

The daily announcements used to be presented on Switch-On on a daily basis. Currently Switch-On is produced only on Thursdays.  The rest of the week, the daily announcements are read by a student over the P.A. system.  The Switch-On program may return to a daily production next year.

Varsity Outdoor cricket is the only official TDSB version of the sport.  Indoor cricket is unique to the schools of the former boards of Etobicoke and York.  Since it is not played in all districts, it is not officially sanctioned by the board.  However, you are correct that the local indoor league is divided into JR and SR divisions.

I see no problem in stating that a significant number of the school’s students are of Somalian Origin, and that the school has made strong effort to work with and connect with the Somalian community.  However, most of the Somalian students now in the school were born in Canada.  Current refugees are more likely to be from Afghanistan.  The demographic of schools like Kipling quickly changes, therefore it is difficult to keep specific statements like “200 Somalian refugees” current.  Why not leave the article more general to better reflect the mosaic of cultures represented within the school.

The YOUCAN program is not an in-house program.  It is run by a private, paid organization.  Originally the program was delivered to small groups of students who showed interest and leadership potential.  Roger Dale introduced the program first to small groups, then to all grades nines, then eventually participation became mandatory for all registered students.  Kipling was the first school to require full participation within this program.  With the apparent, impending requirement for all schools to offer “Character Education” YOUCAN may be positioning itself to become a provider for other TDSB schools.  Perhaps this is why a link was suggested between the introduction of YOUCAN and the drop in the Kipling suspension rate.  However, the prime reason for the drop in suspension rate is that Roger Dale does not believe in the value of suspensions and is a proponent of Progressive Discipline and Restorative Justice as alternatives and prerequisites to suspension. http://www.tdsb.on.ca/pandp/ppdocs/docs/P/P064%20SCH.pdf
The suspension rate for Kipling and its neighbouring academic schools for 2006-2007:  Kipling 2.2 % Martingrove 2.5% Richview 2.8% Scarlett Heights 9.7%.

 more NPOV issues 

This article is pretty sloppy, as I think most people can tell.  I took out the section on first cause as revised by Nodem, which went beyond just poor style and outright called one side of the debate fallacious, which isn't really appropriate in an article on a philosophical topic.

Maybe I went a bit far?  I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own. The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements, space-time is everything, and something exists outside of space-time, are true. However, I work in computer software and don't do physics (although this is really about philosophy), so maybe I'm just using the the wrong kind of logic?  

If time is finite, then there must be a beginning (which is what I think is meant by """"at some point"""").  I don't think the phrase """"came into existence at some point"""" necessarily implies any metaphysical cause (ie: thing/being 'outside' the universe), does it?  06:59, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I wasn't really comfortable with the version that came before it, though.  First cause is a complex topic, or at least a lot has been said about it, and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy.  If someone could write a good article about the first cause debate, and maybe link to it from this article, that would be good.  I'm not really qualified to do it.

Also, and I haven't made an edit about this, I'm uncomfortable, as a physicist, with the statement that most astronomers hold to scientific determinism.  While many do, and they may be right, I can tell you that by far the dominant interpretation of quantum mechanics in physics circles is a nondeterministic one.  Oops!  forgot to login.  I'm misterbailey if anyone was wondering.

You are right to question the most astronomers bitI'll put in a qualifier about macroscopic forces.  I've been working on deterministic system (philosophy), where I put a bit more about quantum physics and determinism, but it is a complex subject.    

I agree that it would be nice if there were a separate article on first causes.  And I agree that this article is sort of sloppy.    Perhaps subheadings could be a first step to clearing it up?

 On the goodness of description and evil of prescription 

The article on grammar suggests in many ways that teaching people how to listen and read is good, but teaching them how to speak and write is wicked. Linguists are said to be concerned """"normally"""" with the former, implying that there is something abnormal about the latter. The notion that we are all culpable when helping people decide how to communicate, when seeking such help, and when making such decisions ourselves, is not only perverse and deplorable, but also patently wrong. We begin our lives incapable of speech. Is it wrong to acquire the ability? Is it right to call instruction in the application of the rules of grammar an invalid activity? Banning prescriptive grammar from the general article on grammar and suggesting that it is illegitimate are serious mistakes, motivated, I suspect, by timidity, laziness, irresponsibility, and ignorance. Only a stubborn, intentional, dedicated ignorance can maintain that proficiency in English composition must not be taught, nor properly called """"grammar"""".  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Congratulations! You win the """"Head Up Your Ass"""" award for being the zillionth person to read one stupid disinformation FAQ about anarchism and think they know it all. FYI, anarchism means:
""""a political theory holding all forms of governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating a society based on voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups"""" Merriam-Webster
""""The theory or doctrine that all forms of government are oppressive and undesirable and should be abolished"""" American Heritage College Dictionary

I think there's a 5th force: long-term editors who believe that they need to/can/can only counter particular editing behavior by altering the policy.  This is exacerbated by their apparent utter unwillingness to see that the effects of the policy they insist upon go far beyond correcting the unwanted behavior.  (They also are or become blind to the fact that the objections raised are due to this unwarranted and disruptive side-effect.)  Actually, the policy probably almost is ineffectual against any behavior: the policy is invoked when the long-term editors challenge the edits.  That the policy says anything about source (or material) types is scarcely noticed by those doing such edits.  We can be virtually certain that any policy wording can and will be used/misused by those with an agenda.  Policy needs to be crafted very carefully.

 Stop being a power freak 

Hi Plumcouch,

Although you are not an administrator, you seem to be a self-styled Wikipedia policeman.  I don't understand why you have been going around giving people strict instructions on what to write and what not to write.  For the Aamir Khan and Vidya Balan pages, you insist on not having links to fansites.  I don't understand why.  If you want the power of an administrator, become an administrator.  Don't take the law into your own hands.

Administrators are not the law. Admins are normal users with more abilities. See here: []

Fan sites are a big problem. First of all, most of them violate copyright laws by displaying pictures which don't have proper copyright information and strictly, those pages are not allowed to display them. If anther page (like Wikipedia) links them, Wiki can get into trouble and with it the entire project. Also, if you add one fansite, you have to add them all. Wiki is no linkfarm and not there to improve people's traffic. Add content instead of links.

Regarding the Meera Jasmine page, you are exceptionally rigid about what belongs in the page and what does not.  You want a citation for everything, and you claim that a lot of the information is not relevant on the page.  Do you want us to say """"Meera Jasmine is an Indian actress"""", immediately put up a citation, scan a copy of her birth certificate and put it up there just to prove that she exists?

I don't doubt she's an actress. Google has various entries on her to prove that. If someone claims she's a devotee of Ganesha, movie xyz has been a mega-super successful film, it would be nice to add citations so you can identify such claims as not merely fangush or rumour which is very common on actor/actress pages. Lots of actor/actress sites don't have references and I admit that's still a big problem.

In the Filmography, I don't understand why you say the director and the co-star belongs in the movie's entry and not in Meera Jasmine's entry.  I'm sure you understand that the career of every actor or actress is shaped by the number of big names he/she works with, and it is a reflection of the actor's career.  So the info certainly belongs to the Meera Jasmine entry.

""""Big names"""" is a very controversial topic. What's big name? Is a big name still big compared to international directors/actors like Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg? Furthermore there have been problems with citing co-stars and directors to show that actor xyz is """"greater"""" than actor abc. If you follow the edit history of actors Ajith and Joseph Vijay, you'll find a good example. In order to stop people and fans from these kind of edit wars, I think it's better to keep filmographies as simple as possible - else, things can easily be mistaken as fangush or hero glorification. Also, most actor/actress pages in the Indian Cinema Project have filmographies with just the roles and the movie - it was universally agreed upon and no one of the participants wanted to change that. If you insist upon changing the way articles at the Project should be written, you can make a formal proposal here: .

And why do you insist on creating links to pages that do not exist, such as the movie pages which do not exist?  If you insist on creating a link, you make sure the link points to something, and if a page does not exist, create the page first before pointing to it.

If you have a red link (one without an article behind it), people easily identify it as such and are generally more easily motivated to click on that link and create the article if they have seen the movies. Those red li",0,0,0,0,0,0

 'Lost Ones' And Jay's relationship with Beyonce 

The article says that """"Many fans disputed this analysis, claiming that the song references a previous relationship with actress Rosario Dawson and that her burgeoning career ended the romance."""" 
That's not what I heard. I read somewhere that the verses were about Beyonce but from years earlier. at the time of Kingdom Come, Beyonce was 25, but the verses refer to the girl being 23. This shows that the verse was written after the black album, and could have been used for Kingdom come. They are clearly back together in Kindom Come, and the song could have been from a rough patch in '04-'05. Both theories are possible and should be included in the article

Wait.  You're not going to block me for posting an RFC?

Or did you block me just so that I couldn't go advertising the RFC on other pages where it might be relevant?

See.  There's the problem. As a non-admin, I am liable to be blackballed by admins, some of whom suffer from Projection (or do they merely think sophistry is administration?):

I performed no personal attacks.  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power.
I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.

I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate """"evidence"""" for a block.
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page).

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner.  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption.

There are 1,7000 admins on this thing.  I have no illusion that all 1,700 of them will be right all the time.  The first 20 who saw Chooserr's postings may have said """"okay by me"""".  It's the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem.  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones.  Meanwhile, a well-meaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong, demonized in the community, and the community is thrown into dysfunction.  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness, intimidation, sophistry, and dismissive attitude, followed by an abuse of power.

Do not block me.  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user.  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps' error rather than taking a skeptical attitude.  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me.

The behavior of the admins in this event is a classic abuse of power: a clique of bullies hiding their damage by increasing it.  """,1,0,0,0,0,0

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

I am sorry to say Mr.Tosa was not invited to that championship. So what you are telling is not true. Sensei Shukumine never had any contact with Tosa after Tosa turned his back on him and started his own commercial Karate organization. Please see also Sensei Shukumine's personal message at a training seminar in The Netherlands with Sensei Kanai and Sensei Konno. Please see the pictures on the Genseiryu website: Taido and Genseiryu people united to celebrate 55 years Genseiryu - 40 years Taido and to commemorate Sensei Shukumine. Besides that there are pictures of Sensei Shukumine teaching several Genseiryu Teachers like Genseiryu Head Instructor Sensei Kanai in Genseiryu Head dojo situated in Ito Japan in 1996. 212.127.137.2 19:37, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Were you at the championship or something? 
So, if Mr. Tosa never had any contact with Mr. Shukumine after 1962, then please explain these picturse of Mr. Tosa and Mr. Shukumine together on the Brazilian Genseiryu website .  Zzaroc 22:01, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I am sorry I didn't say Sensei Shukumine had any contact after 1962. I said he didn't had any contact after Sensei Tosa turned his back to Sensei Shukumine. This was after Sensei Shukumine wrote the preface for sensei Tosa's book about Genseiryu Butokukai. And yes I was present at the championship in Okinawa amongst other Genseiryu practitioners from Spain, Denmark, Holland, and Japan. I will try to give also a link with pictures of that event. I need a little time for that I am not an Internet black belt sorry for that. 212.127.137.2 22:53, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

You don't have to be a black belt, when your good, by the way. But take your time, I am patient.
But I was wondering. Mr. Tosa published his book in 1984, but there still a picture of him together with Mr. Shukumine in 1985 (I mean those pictures on the Brazilian site). Then there are still a few questionmarks.
But by the way, did you know that Mr. Tosa received several letters all over the world, just after Mr. Shukumine died? Those letters were asked for permission if some dojo's could join the organization of Mr. Tosa. Mr. Tosa denied these people to join his organization.
There was one person who send such a letter to Mr. Tosa from Holland, and you may guess who.
And I have got also another question. Mr. Seiken Shukumine past away to an hart attack. But when did he started to get ill?  Zzaroc 23:59, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

No a black belt is not needed to have a certain skill. But in most occasion it shows an amount of training effort,time. And as you probably know training effort makes you become more skillfull.

I don't know when Mr. Tosa turned his back to sensei Shukumine so maybe my remark that they didn't had any contact shouldn't be done by me because I am not aware of that specific date. So I apologize for that. But I heard this occured in the mid till end '80s.

No, I didn't know that Mr. Tosa received several letters from all over the world. I know he claimed to get a letter from Holland. I know he received one which was delivered by someone from Denmark. But I know that the letter was completely different from what is claimed by Mr. Tosa. That is also easy to believe if you are member of a Genseiryu organization in Ito which was directly connected to sensei Shukumine where Sensei Shukumine still gave, in very few occasions, lectures about Genseiryu (pictures are on the way (few days necessary)). So you can imagine you don't beg for acknowledgement by Mr. Tosa who only wants you to train his way, which is very near to Shotokan with the basic kata of Shotokan. This dojo in Holland is not interested in any connection with Mr. Tosa. For what reason, if you want to train Genseiryu the same way as sensei Shukumine taught his students? The Head Instructor of this organization is now Sensei Kanai one of the first students of Sensei Shukumine. In Sensei Shukumine's book """"Shin Karatedo Kyohan"""" there are several pictures of teachers who are still in this group. I met them during the celebrating anniversary of Taido and Genseiryu beginning of this year (Jan. 2005). Many nice teachers who still respect Sensei Shukumine, as should be in the relationship with teacher and student.

I was never involved with the sickness of Sensei Shukumine and I don't like to talk about his sickness. I met Mr. Shukumine one time and talked a little bit with him. In Okinawa I only met him from a distance. So I am sorry I can't anwer this question for I didn't have such a close relationship with Sensei Shukumine.  212.127.137.2 06:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

14.10.2014, 21.08: I then presented the USA Federal Court really heared the case and decided the verdict on Talk page. I have supplied USA Federal Court decision from the official website of the Court.

14.10.2014:21.42: Wikipedian Alexikoua reacted the unknown IP31's vandalism. (edit summary of Alexikoua: """"rv essential part removal""""). Alexikoua is a Hellen, but neutral like me.

15.10.2014:00.37: This time another unknown IP85 appeared and removed the edit without any edit summary. Hence, essentially removed the sourced context that Alexikoua opposes to be removed besides me.

15.10.2014:00.38: Wikipedian MelbourneStar reacted to the unknown IP85's vandalism and protected the edit.

15.10.2014:00.58: This time,  appeared and reverted the edit with edit summary (Reverted 1 edit by MelbourneStar: Sorry Star. IP 31.xx was correct. Reverting undue POV-push by SPA. Please see Arbitration Enforcement report.) without waiting my defense in Arbitration Enforcement and the resulting decision of Arbitration Committee]].

15.10.2014:05.23: Arbitration Committee rejected 

This section is to be edited only by uninvolved administrators. Comments by others will be moved to the section above.
The Arbitration Committee, in their infinite wisdom, determined that Cyprus does not fall under these discretionary sanctions. So unless I've missed something, this case is not currently actionable.  (talk) 
Agreed. Cyprus is not part of the Balkans and therefore not covered by the WP:ARBMAC discretionary sanctions. Closing as not actionable.  

15.10.2014:07.45: I replace the edit whose protection is the consensus of the known Wiki users (Alexikoua,MelbourneStar).

I do not agree with  your close of Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Article Incubator/Marie Charlotte de la Trémoille which I think a classic supervote. There were 4 opinions: the nom's opinion to delete as a stale draft, another editor's opinion to delete because of questionable notability and a stale draft , my opinion to redirect to the apparent subject of the article, and a keep opinion that the subject was notable and that the user thought it could be worked on further, and had a source available.

You decided to delete, admitting that """"this may not look like the right result"""", based on your view that   1/""""it was extremely unlikely that a redirect would help find the associated article""""  perhaps, but it would help the user find at least some information on the named person 2/""""the incubator was a bad idea, 3/there was a user willing to work on it you would undelete  but there wasa user willing to work on it. 

As you didn't delete it, someone placed a speedy on it, which is reasonable of them, but I boldly reversed it while I ask you to reconsider. (If you   hold by your decision & want to revert me, I will not consider it wheel-warring in this circumstance)  Your reasons, 1/ is misconceivedthe pt of the redirect is to find some info on the named subject, which is present in the article redirected toit at least identifies the person 2/your personal opinion that an accepted feature of WP should be closed down, and 3/ the distinction you drew between someone who might work on it and someone who could. 

Since you said, """"if there is a user willing to work on it you would be happy to move it, please  either relist for further discussion,  move it to my user space or that of FactS[pace. or redirect as I suggested. 

And there would be some merit in an argument that a person opposed in principle to the article incubator should not close mfds involving it. If I opposed articles on unpopulated extinct villages in general, should I close such AfDs in conformity to my opinion ? '''''' ( talk ) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

From Jamaica Trolleys by Vincent Seyfried, 1953:
""""In April 1936 the Independent subway, whose """"A"""" line had been operating from the Bronx to Church Ave. since October 1933, opened its [Fulton Street Line.] To give access to this new Rockaway Ave. Station to residents of Cypress Hills and Woodhaven, the [...?] management extended the Jamaica Ave. trolley service from Broadway, the old terminal, westward along Fulton St. to a newly constructed loop at Hopkinson Ave. The new service opened on the same morning as the subway (April 9th) and operated on both weekdays and Sundays. On the same day Fulton St. trolleys were extended along Fulton St. beyond Broadway, their old terminal, out to Crescent St. and Jamaica Ave. The new """"A"""" line of the Inde-pendent subway was immensely popular at the time, not only because it was a novelty, but because it gave un-usually fast, direct service into New York. This Jamaica Avenue service into the Hopkinson Loop continued right [...?] to the end of 1947. The middle and late 30's witnessed the gradual isola-tion of the Jamaica Ave. line. In December of 1933 the Jamaica Central Rys. motorized their lines, ending 37 years of ¡oint operation through the old village of Jamaica, and leaving the avenue east of 168th St. to the city line without trolleys.

First, I will be civil as long as you're civil to me. So far, you're the one who shot the first volley when you called me """"fanboy"""". In kind, I had no choice but to shoot it back to you; all's fair in love and war. 

Second, I will counter your points with authentic references of my own which I will post for evidence that backs up my argument about punk's distinction. When I do, you better NOT remove them, pursuant to wiki's policy. Doing so will reveal you as a hypocrite, with all due respect.

Lastly, and again with all due respect, you are not an appropriate source for information regarding punk. If you fail to realize that punk and grunge have far less in common; that punk is in a class all its own and was not influenced by """"60's garage rock"""" - whatever that means; and that your personal taste precludes me as a credible source from my long, personal experience in the punk industry, then, you cannot be allowed to further bend punk history to your personal liking. 

To recap, I will provide adequate references. DO NOT edit the article back to its original falsehood when I do since I will have furnished you with proof/references.

9ace530c4c711d19,"I never said it would happen. I just said that I wouldn't be suprsed if it does. I made that guess based on everything that's happened so far in Naruto, and the way Kishimoto creates plot twists of this kind. Now your comment is what seems fanboyish and unjustifiable. Kabuto already seemed to have a kind of kind of second nature back during the first part of the series where his eyes would change color when he got mad. Kishimoto wouldn't give him a similar state to Juugo, because it wouldn't be something that new and because he wouldn't want to have two characters be so similar. And as for my Orochimaru possesing Itachi theory, just because something happens at one point doesn't mean it will be the same story next time. By your logic, just because Kakashi needed the help of his students (look 2-3 people right there!) to bail him out of Zabuza's trap during their first meeting, that would mean Zazbuza could have easily killed him during their second meeting when they were fighting alone. Or just because even Gaara's own father, the Kazekage himself, feared Gaara's power, a genin like Naruto shouldn't have been able to beat him let alone after he transformed. Or how could the Uchiha, being the strongest clan of Konoha, be killed so easily by a single member of their village? See? You definetly chose the wrong story to bring up that kind of logic. Practically every single fight in Naruto craps all over it. Orochimaru COULD take over Kabuto, and go on to Itachi after Sasuke's team has weakened him. Perhaps they cause him to overuse his Sharingan eyes, who knows? Orochimaru could find him, make his move, steal his body, and seek vengeance on Sasuke. The point is just that neither of us knows whats gonna happen and we'll just have to read the story.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Please listen to the administrator and if you have a serious edit dispute, have it moderated.

The fact that you are campaigning, yes, CAMPAIGNING for your point of view after the issues are resolved is bad form. Oh, and by the way, just a hint here: Wiki doesn't tolerate sock puppets. You know what I mean. 
  

Pardon me, but it appears you're being far more vocal than I am on this matter. And you haven't proven anything to me. The only way you can be said to have proven something to me is if I am conviced of it.
I think we're all capable of discussing this without needing moderation.

 Your ACE questions 

Hi there. In previous years the elections have had problems with the sheer amount of questions asked, and with the quality of the questions asked. No solution has made itself apparent, so I'm going to try something new:

I believe your asking of ten questions, and the threat you placed behind them, is inappropriate. If you wanted to ask general questions to all the candidates, there was an opportunity to have them included in the general questions section. Moreover, many of your questions can be combined, thus reducing the overall burden on both the candidate, and more importantly, on the community (which will probably have to read 100s of answers now). Please consider reducing the number of questions you've asked. I can see a way to turn it into six questions by combining several of them (13+14+15) and scrapping two (18 as largely duplicitive to general question 2, and 12 as not having to do with ArbCom).

populism as a positive term, and a critique of critics

Since I wrote last fall, several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred. The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion, building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18, """"Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance"""" (http://www.wolpetrust.org.za/dialogue2007/mangcupaper.pdf ). In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of """"populism"""" that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of """"Enlightenment rationalism"""" and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079

As far as Mike Huckabee's """"populism"""" is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (""""Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee"""") has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

From the Boston Globe:Lieberman, a Democrat who won reelection as an independent, also said he wants to be called an Independent Democrat.A strong backer of the Iraq war, Lieberman was returned to office on Election Day with strong GOP support. He ran as an independent after he lost the Democratic primary in August to Ned Lamont.He said yesterday on NBC's """"Meet the Press"""" that he will begin his new term as a Democrat because it would make him part of the congressional leadership. The senator is in line to become chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.""""I'm going to caucus with the Democrats both because it's good for my constituents in Connecticut, because I retained my seniority, I become a committee chair, but also I want to continue to work to bring the party back to its historic traditions of strength on national security, foreign policy, and innovation and progress in domestic policy,"""" Lieberman said.He said that because voters returned him to Capitol Hill as an independent, """"I am now an Independent Democrat  capital I, capital D. Matter of fact, the secretary of the Senate called my office and asked, 'How do you want to be identified,' and that's it. Independent Democrat,"""" the senator said.With many Senate Democrats having campaigned or raised money for Lamont, as the party's nominee, Lieberman acknowledged that it might be """"a little awkward"""" for him back in Washington.""""They played by the traditional partisan political playbook.

The comments by BritishWatcher show the problems at present.

I gave him a simple choice, assume good faith and take me at my word, or buy the book. Instead he chose option C, whine and assume bad faith.

He asserts I have not provided an alternate text written from the source instead of the current text. If he had bothered to read the discussion, he would realise I have said more than once that it is not possible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source. So I cannot do that.

The problems are quite simple:

The original sentence which was copied to the lead (complete with egregious modifications of the original sentence to mean something completely different!) did not match the source, and is therefore unsourced.
It is impossible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source.
Various editors have produced no sources at all to support any figures about injuries or opinions they have said should be included in the lead.
Various editors refuse to allow an unsourced (as the text does not match the source in any way) sentence to be removed from the article. They are so insistent on retaining an incorrect, unsourced sentence. Not only that, they keep proposing equally incorrect, unsourced sentences that either cite zero sources or inaccurately cite the existing source.
I have asked many times why the reader should be misled. It is quite telling that nobody dare give me a straight policy based answer to that question, especially when the protection policy allows for its removal.

Rather than surveying scientists, look at the fundamentals.  Effects of water are dominant over CO2.   I’m told that IPCC models apply controversial positive feedback factors to enhance the effect of CO2, and using values that are too high would explain why their models do not fit recent observations.  Illustrative links follow: -

Water vapour dominates.

Your AfD participation is looking good so far, although I would like to see more detailed rationales (WP:AADD is a good read if you haven't discovered it already).

 Anonymous Editor RfA 

Hi Brian. My comment on the RfA page was brief, so it's not surprising it was confusing as well.  As I clarified to Bababjou, while I did express concerns about his POV editing, I find Anonymous Editor generally reasonable in discussion, and don't see any reason to think he would abuse his admin privileges.  In addition, I think that Wikipedia would benefit from multiple POVs.  Also, I think the Muslim related articles get a lot of vandalism, and it would be helpful to have an admin patrolling them more regularly. (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Are you kidding me, Irpen? Or the readers of my talkpage? I want everyone going to tell fairy-tales here to make a respective warning in the beginning of his text. Even if tales are put down by such a skilled and polite writer as you are  ;).

It's just opposite! RU shauvenism is established and encouraged by the state policy of RF, both domestic and foreign (namely of Putin). And, since they have no democracy and TV freedom at all (while we have very little), what may the mainstream view  be, if not imperialistic shauvenism? While in UA excessive liberalism and (ocassionally stupid) tolerance is the state policy. That was the layout of my POV. But. It IS NOT a usenet group indeed. So I'll try to support my point with balanced editing, links and citations.

One night in an online coffee house, a self-ordained Zen Master named Moulton said to him, """"Go to the dilapidated mansion you will find at the URL which I have written down for you.  Do not speak to those who dwell there; you must remain silent until the Moonbeam's students arise.  Go to the large parlor on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, stand humbly in the corner, and meditate.""""

He did just as the Moultonic Zen Master instructed. His meditation was frequently interrupted by worries, anxieties, and the occasional Bombesin rush.  He worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would tumble from the second floor toilet to join the pipes and other debris he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when Moonbeam's students arose for their next blogfest on Ethics in Journalism.  He worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him.  Man, I tell you, this guy had spilkes.

His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of his faith, courage, and personal integrity, Moulton's provocative responses fell from the upper stories onto him.  At that time two Wikipedia editors blithely sauntered into the scene.  The first asked the second who the man was sitting there was.  The second replied """"Some say he is a holy man. Others say he is a shithead."""" 

Hearing this, the troubled young man became enlightened, if only for a brief instant of cosmic time.

50dbb0d84967fe2c,"This is now very concerning. I emailed Elonka last night about my scepticism as to the real identity of these posts. My suspicions arose when I received an email from (a) Lord Knowle to help edit the Knights Templar article. Looking back on it later it did seem diferent from the usual style that I would normally get from the person that I know who owns this account. I was very puzzled over the temperament and writing style of the edits on the Knights Templar page. The attacks on the Earl of Bradford seem very similar, someone who has also been attacked for their campaign against pseudo-Templar websites. LK is also very private about his involvement and doesn't participate on public forums on this subject. If he had wanted to do so, then he would have done so a lot earlier in the article's lifecycle than these last few weeks. Having spent a good few hours going through all his edits there is even one that was posted when I was speaking to him on his mobile. I have checked the date and time entry and on that day he was in Suffolk, over 200 miles away from his home. I would urgently request that LK's account is locked until this is checked out.

I doubt it that the Wikipedia introductory sentence warning about damaging a living person refers solely to:
go ahead, say what you want as long as you cannot be caught from the legal view point you can write everything you wish. 

I think Wikipedia refers to some honor and honesty in talking about a living person who can be damaged in his/her reputation and can suffer financial damage as well in his business .
So, it is a question of honor and good editorial behavior in keeping with the truth.

You are pointing out the fact that the Wikipedia article on Ruggero Santilli talks about fringe. The difference between  what that article says and what the Oxyhydrogen  article says is the difference between being fair and being recklessly mean and damaging.
This is my example:

Steve is a photographer and some of his work is considered unprofessional , childish and """"fringe"""" 
(physicist Ruggero Santilli  who is proponent of ideas some of which have been considered fringe theories) as it is in the article about Ruggero Santilli

Steve is an unprofessional photographer and he is an unprofessional """"fringe"""" photographer
( fringe physicist Ruggero Santilli) as in the Oxyhydrogen article

You are saying that Santilli is clueless about electrolysis and therefore all his work is 'fringe"""" ......
how about his books in other subjects published by Plenum, Springer Verlag, Nuovo Cimento?Did you read the? 
You say that you want sources, peer -reviewed article and yet you do not like the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy and cite Calo as having negative comments...how about the positive comments on Santilli's work by Cloonan and Trell in the same Journal? They are University professors .... you also do not like their universities? Do they have a poor reputation in your view? How about Santilli's article in the American Institute of Physics ? AIP also has a poor reputation? 

I added  verbatim to the Oxyhydrogen article only what Wikipedia has in the other article about Santilli. You are confusing people who sell stuff on TV and defraud customers, from the work of reputable scientist who publish and work and are seeking the truth as much as you do and because of this you call  """"fraud, bogus, fringe, nut job. Bunching these two categories (the TV fraud and the researchers)  together is not """"seeking the truth"""" but being reckless and damaging, especially when it was pointed out to you without calling you bogus, nut, fringe ( which could  be justified by par condicio) but I am not doing it for respect toward the readers and especially myself.
Please do not go back to ethics.

Request For Mediation In Removing Mclellan and The Marine Corps From Manookian's Page [Armenian Issues]
I have tried to informally resolve the editing issues on Arman Manookian to no avail. As a matter of fact, I requested mediation with no response. Moreover, a consensus of Assisting Editors informed me, when I tried to include Arman Manookian on the List of Historically Notable Marines, that Arman Manookian was merely a clerk and nothing more and did not warrant such inclusion and was not part of Marine Corps History. Based on that guidance, I deleted references to McClellan [a Marine Corps Historian] on Manookain's page. Now, I note, the very same editors who opined that Manookian did not warrant inclusion on the List of Historically Notable Marines, insist on including McClellan's name and the Marine Corps on Manookian's page for propaganda purposes. I have repeatedly pointed out that this type of inclusion detracts from Manookian's accomplishments independent of the United States Marine Corps History. It appears as though a double and convoluted standard applies and it is very offensive to Armenians. Moreover, 3 linked references to McClellan and the Marine Corps confuse the readers as to who really the article is about. Is it about Manookian or Mclellan or the United States Marine Corps? Although I am assuming Good Faith, several witnesses are absolutely dismayed at this type of conduct and it should be noted that it gives the appearance of Bias for a POV and propaganda. I don't believe Mediation is consistent with an Editing War. Moreover, as I stated before in assuming Good Faith, it appears as though Manookian's page is being collaborated to sell art and recruit for the Marine Corps. Yet when simple solutions are offered, such as including Manookian and McClellan on the List of Historically Notable Marines, it is ignored because his last name ends in IAN and the fact that he committed suicide as a self imposed martyr. Despite the fact that on the Editor Assistance page the question posed was not answered and then listed as answered, I followed the guidance of those editors who in essence stated that the reason Manookian was taken off the List of Historically Notable Marines was because he was a clerk and McClellan only said nice things about [his name and fame are intertwined with it [Marine Corps History]] him because he felt sorry that Manookian committed suicide and not because he had anything to do with him being the first Marine Corps historical artist/illustrator. I followed their guidance and hope you follow their guidance as well.  This type of conduct cannot stand and it will be noted or publicized. Moreover, there seems to be a concerted effort by so-called volunteer editors who have a keen eye either on my edits or on Marine Corps History that have a problem with historically notable Marines whose last names end in IAN or who volunteered for suicide missions. Apparently, it has something to do with recruitment of Armenians for Martyrdom during WWII and the Marine Corps' subsequent treacherous conduct of ignoring those very same Armenian American Marines for political and financial reasons. At this point I ask that an administrator watch this page very carefully as it relates to an Armenian American Marine who cannot defend himself from scavengers.   00:44, 10",0,0,0,0,0,0

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!""",1,0,0,0,1,0

Contradiction between sources
Hi all. For now, I've removed this:

In 1840, an orthodox Jewish community constituted the largest single religious group in the city.Grenville, John Ashley Soames. A history of the world from the 20th to the 21st century; Routledge, 2005. pg. 456. ISBN 0415289556

I cannot access the text and would like to see it. I also think picking 1840 is arbitrary.  This source which provides a population table for Jerusalem from 1806 - 1945 on page 28 indicates that in 1838 the population was 11,500 people (4,500 Muslims, 3,500 Christians, and 3,000 Jews); in 1846 the population was 17,173 (6,100 Muslims, 3,558 Christians, and 7,515 Jews) and that in 1851 it was 25,354 (12,286 Muslims, 7,488 Christians, and 5,580 Jews). Given the city had become an important administrative capital for the Ottoman empire in the 19th century, its not suprising that there were new arrivals all the time from all three religious groups. I don't think we need to focus on 1840 in isolation. talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speedy deletion of Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Mantin
 A tag has been placed on Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Mantin requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. ♠Dil  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am unable to treat your explanation as clear and specific because it does not cite specific edits nor demonstrate how the edits match your description. Since you brought it up, WP:AGF says: """"Even if bad faith is evident, do not act uncivilly yourself in return, or attack others or lose your cool over it. It is not necessary to be a fanatic yourself. Even though it demands a lot of self control and patience, it is ultimately a lot easier for others to resolve a dispute and see who is breaching policies, if one side is clearly editing appropriately throughout .... Making unwarranted accusations of bad faith (as opposed to explanations of good faith) can be inflammatory, and is often unhelpful in a dispute. If bad faith motives are alleged without clear evidence that others' editing is in fact based upon bad faith, it can also count as a form of personal attack, and in it, the user accusing such claim is not assuming good faith.""""

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface.

How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase.

 The Truth About Me, Stephen 

Hello, you sexy little love-hole!
I am seeking hot, kinky sex; that is why I am here.  I am seeking a large, hairy, ape-like man to discipline me.  I like it when big men talk dirty to me whilst pounding their rock-hard schingslongs into my mangina; just thinking about it makes my tiny little micro-penis perk up like Hitler on meth. I want a big, strong man to beat me up whilst another muscular hunk restrains me and whispers obscenities into my innocent little ear.  I especially like it when I am called 'a cum-guzzling, dick-sucking, fellating, felching, shit-sniffing, nigger-worshipping, homosexual man-slut,' for I know, in my heart, that this description of me is extremely accurate.  Please, big, hairy men, I want to be your ass-slave, serving you and satisfying you with my bunghole for as long as my submissive soul remains in this world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111one1111won11  I will even pay you large sums of money if that is necessary.  Contact me as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!one1111111111111111won1111

 Spanish heraldry 

As a respected contributor to the above article, you're probably best placed to deal with the issues with it. If you want to take it on, I believe there is a lack of: inline citations in particular; good English; and specificity - parts of the article explain heraldry in general, and are not sufficiently (IMHO) to be included in the article (eg. most of the Definitions section).

 BCN-SIA discussion 

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Because of that, I have """"twicked"""" the comment from """"until summer 2009"""" to """"probably until summer 2009, in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners""""
In the article, the text refered (Today the SiA flights carry out the Singapore-Malpensa-Barcelona route but in short time the flight will be reduced to Singapore-Malpensa route, while the continuation to Barcelona will be assured by Lufthansa Italia), is not referenced as Bonomi's words but as an explanation by Avionews.
The comments is not anymore an affirmation but a puntuation between brackets. Sincerely, I fail to see your urge to remove it. Cheers. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!).

Can't help you on this one.  My sole interest in that page was reverting the vandalism done by 216.11.148.3.  If you've got good sourced info, Be Bold and update the article!   

/\/\ Hello. You sent a message to this IP about vandalism, i have an an explanation. This address is shared by the entire ACISD campus. If it was blocked, more than 1500 people would be deprived of this great site. Thanks! /\/\   
First: just as a minor FYI, the best way to leave comments is on my talk page. I've moved your comments from my user-page to my talk page (get there by clicking on the """"discussion"""" tab on the user page). Secondly, I do understand your concern about the block; be assured that this only applies to edits, not simple viewing-you will still be able to see all the information Wikipedia has to offer! Finally, you can register your own ID and contribute that way to the Wikipedia-stand out from those 1500 as a unique contributor!

Sorry - I've just noticed I should have reverted to your version, but just reverted to an earlier version by the vandal instead. Thanks for spotting and fixing it. He's had a {{test4a}}, and I'm now watching his contributions like a hawk. talk 
Not a problem-it's easy to lose track when you have so many folks looking to squash the vandals!   

Vandalism
This is a school IP address. I just got this message while reading on Wikipedia and had nothing to do with said revisions. However, as a sidenote, theres plenty of nonsense on Wikipedia. Just look at furry and otherkin.  
Understood.  However, as you'll also see, there are a lot of people using their school IP addresses to vandalize Wikipedia, so we have little choice but to apply the warnings to the IP.  You can, however, register with Wikipedia.  In this manner, your IP's actions will very likely not reflect on you or any other valid editor using your IP.    
Note-added shared ip-edu template to user's talk page.

The production of such lists, and the tagging, could be automated, and all you'd really need is people to weed out the false positives.

Thanks for uploading Image:Roy Romanow.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

I hope you like this place — I sure do — and want to stay. Before getting too in-depth, you may want to read about the Five pillars of Wikipedia and simplified ruleset. If you need help on how to title new articles check out the naming conventions, and for help on formatting the pages visit the manual of style. If you need help look at Wikipedia:Help and the FAQ , plus if you can't find your answer there, check the Village Pump (for Wikipedia related questions) or the Reference Desk (for general questions)! There's still more help at the Tutorial and Policy Library. Plus, don't forget to visit the Community Portal. And if you have any more questions after that, feel free to post them on my user talk page or place {{helpme}} on your talk page and someone will be by to help you shortly.

Moreover I also find it extremely odd that all articles and references to the Armada Shopping mall are systematically deleted by the same handful of editors protecting the DrakeCircus mall.

f5f404e4a2614ae4,"""== Re: Telstra Article ==

Hello. I am new to Wiki but thought I had read the T&Cs; fairly well. I am surprised at the number of citations you are demanding for my edit to the Telstra mobile page. Many of the facts you are seeing citations for are indesputible engineering realities and hence you wont find a seperate statement from someone claiming same (although you may find news paper articles backing some of the claims). The points made about 850 having superior coverage to 2100 cant be disputed and I would ask since that being the case, what sort of citation should I be looking for to back up the statement?

I accept referencing Whirlpool for carrier customer numbers is a bit slack. The only reason I did that was that in that discussion thread was a neatly pulled together list of each carriers end of year reports showing their customer base - which highlighted the point that Telstra is the largest carrier by subscriber base at this time. Considering that it is not appropriate to reference a forum thread, how can I best reference this to Wikipedia's satisfaction?

I also note that you removed the citations that pointed back to Telstra.com. The third party aspect of your requirement there is almost not appropriate when you are refering to direct history or a Telstra product reference on the topic. Specifically, the references to Telstra having the first automated mobile network are hard to find anywhere else but on Telstra's media pages - because quite frankly no other operator is going to want to talk about it, and no other Australian source of any repute exists on the internet that would be bothered backing up such claims that I have been able to find (again I dont like quoting news papers because there is no traceability as to the reliability of their sources in the first place - an encyclopedia based on newspapers is a sure way to enshrine into history some editors' warped viewpoint which may or may not be right, but someone reading something and seeing a reference pointing at a news paper may not recognise as simply being another editors point of view.

Please, can you outline how I can more effectively cite elements of my contribution and to an extent justify your requirements for citations where I have not yet been able to find any suitable meaningful references?
   

Hi. I'm not sure if you have checked out Wikipedia:Reliable sources which also links to many other wiki policies. If there is a few lines in the article which is in a source you can cite it more then once using [cite information here] once then adding  on the other sentences with in the article. 

Whirlpool isn't a reliable source but other if it links to a source you could use that source instead but as long as it's reliable source and a third party source.  

Websites Telstra and any company it owns isn't a third party source which can be seen a bias and can be seen as a point of view which it way we use third party sources (See Self-published sources).

Newspapers can be used whether or not it's a website or you can just reference the title of the article, name of the paper, page, date it was printed and who the story was written by, As you can trace Newspapers who's stories may not be online or the story was before the internet was around. I hope this helps.   

 Thanks for the warning 

But I already tried the talk page, and rather than discussing the issue there, user: Ryulong opted to revert.  I notice only I'm accused of edit warring.  Does war require two parties, or are you just supporting the use of Wikipedia for spam and fighting hard for it?

I must quote what Dominus wrote some time ago on my talk page when I translate I use """"Province of Lower Silesia"""" etc. However, here on Wikipedia, I have to go with decisions made long ago. The problem is that Wikipedia is increasingly used for reference by people who are not translators. They should be aware that in """"real life"""" the use of """"voivodeship"""" results in confusion, as foreigners usually have no idea what this word means. Some Polish people may not care about it because Polish is a reader-responsible language, so Polish authors do not need to write understandably because readers are responsible for understanding. By contrast, English is a writer-responsible language, i.e. writers in English are responsible for making their texts understandable. (I wrote about the classification and some other problems related to translation in my article, pages 101-104). Importantly, this is reflected in the Wikipedia Manual of Style, as one of the five general principles of Wikipedia is Clarity: Writing should be clear and concise. Plain English works best: avoid jargon, and vague or unnecessarily complex wording. """"Voivodeship"""" is jargon, understandable nearly exclusively to Polish people.

 Ownership of this article 

My apologies for trying to edit your article, HelenOnline.  I didn't realise that this was your article.  I will not edit it again.  

I saw that the article had not been updated with the important closing arguments so I thought to update it.  I guess I should have realised that you owned it, by the way that you reverted everything, with a nasty message to my talk page on top of the reversion, sure signs of ownership.  I took it on face value that really all you wanted were references, as you complained so bitterly about my daring to add in things that you claimed were false.  I mean, you couldn't possibly be trying to damage my reputation just so that you could continue to own the page, could you?

I have no problem with a page being owned, HelenOnline, but I really think that at the top of the page it should say """"This article written by ....."""" and then it should say your real name.  Then people reading this can account for your biases.  And then, if, let's say, Oscar Pistorius, or Barry Roux, or Gerrie Nel, or someone else, think that what you have added is false, and want to sue you for publishing inaccurate information, then they will know to sue you, HelenOnline, rather than poor old Wikipedia.

I saw that you added a lot of false information to this article, HelenOnline.  Furthermore, I see that you deleted a lot of accurate information, while pretending that it was false.  Most dangerously, you used citations then misquoted what they said.  Very dangerous, that.

As I had said above, I really think that it is safer for you, HelenOnline, to recuse yourself from this article.  You have had major fights with several editors here, which has resulted, in your words, with you """"scaring them off"""", as you put it.  

I don't know precisely what happened with them, as all I can see are their comments in the talk page above, and looking through the history, but if it anything similar to the abuse I was subjected to, both from you, and by people who blindly support you without bothering to check facts, then I am sure that it was serious.  I got banned for 3 whole days for personal attacks, for asking you to recuse yourself!  Wow!  Just wow!  And as a result, you get to revert my edits unopposed, you get to abuse me all over Wikipedia, I get banned and on top of that the article gets locked in a false state, so that the truth will never be told.

It's on your head, HelenOnline, and everyone who supports you.  This article belongs to you, and if someone decides to sue you, on the completion of the trial on 11 September, I for one won't be held responsible for your false edits.

 In the edit summary of your second edit of this article, you incorrectly state that """"Clearly there is some dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article. This tag should not be removed until this dispute is resolved."""" What there was was this group of I.P. addresses engaged in vandalism and other disruptive behavior, with one person (69.230.175.35, with possibly this same person using one or more of the other I.P. addresses) ending the """"dispute"""" with an act of vandalism in addition to the message """"You know what fuck off [some Anglo-Saxon name]. I want to see how much you can take before you crack.""""

 So in fact there had been no authentic """"dispute about the accuracy and neutrality of this article"""". The """"Omega Point (Tipler)"""" article is accurate in describing the Omega Point Theory, with thorough citations provided. The article follows Wikipedia policy of WP:NPOV, as the article does not claim that the Omega Point Theory is true, but instead is written in the neutral point of view: it describes the Omega Point Theory, but it does not claim that it is correct. The article uses neutral-point-of-view language, such as """"According to Tipler from a 2005 paper in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics, he outlines the following reasons why he maintains ...""""

 In the edit summary of your first edit of this article, you state """"Obvious really, who the hell is repeatedly removing this categorisation?"""", referring to the """"Category:Pseudoscience"""" edit added by said person or persons engaged in vandalism, nonsense edits and disruptive edits. Your edit summary falsely makes it seem as if this edit has long been in the article, and that it has just recently been removed, which is incorrect. Your edit here also violates Wikipedia policy, such as WP:Truth and WP:NPOV. Prof. Frank J. Tipler's Omega Point Theory has been peer-reviewed and published in a number of the world's leading physics journals, and so under WP:Reliable Sources does not qualify as """"pseudoscience"""". Your phraseology of """"who the hell"""" also violates WP:Civility.

 You claim WP:Undue Weight for the latest factually-incorrect edits, yet almost the entirety of the peer-reviewed paers in science journals are in support of the Omega Point Theory. There has only been one refereed paper in a physics journal that was critical of Prof. Tipler's Omega Point Theory, but the authors of that paper unwittingly gave an argument that unless the Omega Point comes about then the laws of physics are violated, and so thereby actually gave a powerful argument for the Omega Point Theory's correctness. Tipler cites this article in support of his Omega Point Theory in his 2005 Reports on Progress in Physics article.

 Regarding critical reviews of Tipler's books, none of them have been refereed in science journals. They are book reviews that have not undergone the referee process that is required of actual papers.

 Prof. Tipler and his Omega Point Theory have been in the news recently. This has drawn the attention of ideologically-motivated people who upon hearing of it take an extreme visceral dislike to it.

Hey Koreans, who the fuck do you think you're dealing with. Guess what, Gaogouli was a Chinese vassal you stupid fucks.

Most Gaogouli descendants are Chinese.

With the sole exception of Ansi fort itself, Tang troops destroyed Gaogouli soldiers on the battlefield, despite being a significantly smaller force. If anything, Gaogouli only DEFENDED itself from assaults from Sui and Tang. Gaogouli was a mere Chinese vassal, nothing more. The greatest threat came from the TuBo, TuJue and HuiHe from the west.

Actually, I think it's good wikiquette to always give a reason for reversion to the user regardless of whether they're new or old. For that reason I did, though this seems to have escaped you completely. """"interesting, though if it's copied, it can't go here. Original work only (with references)"""" means """"No, you can't just say """"copied from a defib article"""", as that violates WP:C"""". Further evidence to back up the fact that it was copied can be found in the form of this users submission to the defib article, which was identical. Another thing I didn't bother to mention was that it was written with a slight POV slant - suggesting that using an AED is bad full-stop, when in fact in the absence of a normal defib, it's priceless. Regardless, contrary to your comments, I reverted a) with good reason, and b) with good comments.

ff7f3e14fe0ae328,"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority.

From the main article about Hugo Chavez:

Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus' personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his left-wing and progressivist views. He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro's health.

I find it ironic that an atheist such as Hugo Chavez would ask the Venezuelan people to pray to God for another atheist's (Fidel Castro) health! This just shows what a hypocrite and liar Chavez is!",1,0,0,0,0,0

 Pornography 

I removed """"pornography"""" from examples of hyperreality.  Though I certainly understand what the author was thinking, not everything considered """"pornographic"""" by everyone's standards is necessarily """"hyperreal.""""  Without delving into the differing definitions of pornography, there's a specific example I can think of which illustrates my argument.  Let's say someone makes an amateur video of him or herself having intercourse, and let's postulate that this person decides to sell said video for whatever reason.  Since it's a depiction of a sex act and it's being distributed, this video would be considered pornographic by most definitions.  Nothing about it, however, is inherently hyperreal.  Someone might be interested in purchasing it for the purpose of sexual arousal, and I acknowledge that being aroused by a digital representation is clearly a """"hyperreal"""" act, but that doesn't make this piece of pornography hyperreal in and of itself.  This might be an odd example, but I think it serves to illustrate that """"pornography"""" is too vague and subjective a concept to consider inherently hyperreal.  But perhaps I'm totally wrong.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I need some help 

Hello, I see you are a custodian, saw your message on the fair use issue. I am in the middle of negotiating with a photographer for a free license on an image posted previously as a fair use item. He wants it to be in Wikipedia but there is a language barrier and he needs help understanding what his choices are. I am worried am going to explain it poorly to him. He is from Switzerland and asked me to keep it simple and short how I explain it, not send him a link to a legal manual. Can you help me? I am conversing with him via email. I do not want to post his email address publicly here unless I get his approval. If you want to talk to me in email about this, my email address works in my box here. It is about an image Chowbok tagged and an additional one as well so I don't want to delay explaining the licenses to this person. I don't want him to be confused. He is a professional. I want him to understand well enough that he even opts not to license it if it is not best for him. We could try to get something else if it is not the right thing for him. But I think he would like to do this if we can just help him understand. What protects his photo credit best? GFDL? CC BY SA? Also, the GFDL mentions in the text that someone copying 100 copies or more must be given the source code, which is meaning a software package. For a photo, I hope the """"source code"""" would not be any greater image than what he gives us to put in Wikipedia. He may even decide to give us a bigger image than what we have up currently.

Hi Maralia, hope you're having a good summer. I was wondering if I could ask you for a massive favour and ask you to have a look at India House. This is actually a sort of sub-article of HGC, but stands out on its own right, and I sorta ran throught it in the last week.

I too have never heard the term """"chip romney"""". I'll remove it as soon as I finish writing this- it's unofficial, and isn't a nickname of sorts.
According the the Romney Marsh page, it does extend into Sussex, so by all means we should re-write the location to include this.
I think what you are referring to in your third point was a bit of a mistranslation. Where I don't really know anything about the place of Romney Marsh, I think the editor who wrote that part meant that one of the reasons Romney's were such a success in this area was because of their hardiness. Perhaps this could be re-written too- but as I said, I don't know too much about the place, so I'll leave that to other editors.
For point four, we really need to find external sources to back this up.
For the black points, we should write a section that incorporates a world-wide view. This article is generally focused on one or two areas of the world, so we should really include the general standards for each country. In Australia, for instance, at the shows I've gone to pink on the nose is generally looked down on, but if it's a 'good' sheep, this is minor, and is overlooked quite a bit. Discoloured hooves, however, tend to have more weight on a judge's decision. It's really a matter of who's judging. I'm not sure about other countries, but I do know in the US pink has a lot more weight on a judge's decision than most other countries.
Agreeing with you on your 6th point. Crimp also needs to be defined.
Point 7- you seem to know more on the uses of Romney wool. Keep in mind that we'll need to find reliable external sources for this information.
Point 8- Romney interest in Australia has dropped off considerably, but as you say in NZ is still very high. Again, see what I said before- the article needs to incorporate a worldwide view.
Altogether, the article needs expansion, more reliable sources and a worldwide view. With enough work, we could even get this up to GA standard. ''''''  talk |

 Attention Admin 02 - Ongoing WP:GAMING and Tendentious editing by user   

Again this relates to WP:GAME and appears to need referral to ANI due to ongoing warnings over Dalit and related subjects references. 

The edits made under meisleading edit summary remove Multiple and Different references and not just one as indicated falsely. The content of the page Rape culture page is significant.  

The edits by  (Diff)have removed the following:

In 1999, Palagummi Sainath writing in The Hindu newspaper """"A dalit goes to court"""" revealed how dalit women were told they had to pay to both enter a police station and to file a report of rape. Police were challenged over this issue by Amnesty International, but whilst claiming the issue was being addressed legally were unable to explain any mechanism or records that showed any such action. 

The edits have been made under the guise of removing the following Source Diff:

Rape Culture  Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology (2007)Rape culture is a concept of unknown origin and of uncertain definition; yet it has made its way into everyday vocabulary and is assumed to be commonly understood. The award-winning documentary film Rape Culture made by Margaret Lazarus in 1975 takes credit for first defining the concept."""" - doi: 10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x 

The editing of the Rape culture talk page also warrants assessment as the last editor """"Hex"""" has a history of partisan editing which they have had to be warned against at Arbitration - and the cl;aims made and removal fo valid and correct references to Blackwell seem to have been a precursor to other improper editing of  article space.TTFN    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""". 
Just to refresh old memories Cuba was suppose to be for Cubans at the beginning of the revolution. For a while Now because the commander was afraid of loosing his grip on power he had to",1,0,0,0,0,0

There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community. Balkan history has labelled such people as GREKOMANS, a form of mental malignacy cited in Larousse dictionaries. Their illusion is MEGALI IDEA of Greek nationalism-expandism.They have been allied with Armenian, Serbian and Cypriot extremists of similar interest. THEY HAVE CONSTITUTED A WIKIPEDIAN GUNG, A GREEK PRAPAGANDA LOBBY, A GREEK EPSILON TEAM. All member of group are very radical nationalists. They work continously in three shifts over day and night.
To verify chek their  contributions, talk page, edits, deletions, blocks, directs, protected pages and act  properly. Wikipedia isn’t the right place to propagandize for “God’s elit nations” as Greece.

10b5fe4e99cf4f83,"Re: My Behavoir that day 

Yes, I know it was a bit awful. But the bot probably didn't get the jokes I made in my poem anyhow.

I read Aristophanes earlier that day and was taking the piss out of the wikipedia system and taking the piss out of that dork there.

I don't really care about this wikipedia anyhow. I can make another one, and change my IP address (also I use my college computer and they cannot trace the network anyhow there) so I am alright.

Now here you, Siafu, go misquoting me again.  I did not describe the solution of the navigation equations as the intersection of three spheres.  I said, """"I clearly understand that the GPS navigation equations consist of n (n greater than 3) equations for the surfaces of n spheres and that the solution of these n equations consists of a clock bias and a point at the intersection of these n sphere surfaces"""".  This of course implies that the position part of the solution is at an intersection of any three of the n spheres but this is not a description of the solution but instead an implication of the solution.    

Kendall, credentials certainly do matter since if you don't have the proper education then you can't understand the material and are certainly unqualified to write.  Also, Kendall, pride is a virtue.  I am very proud that I have received a superior quality of education and that I have had a highly successful engineering career.  The fact that I have the great virtue of pride does not mean that I do not treat others with respect and civility.
