Seizures under the 'Trading with the Enemy' Act, 1942
Article phrasing seems contradictory.  First it says the companies were seized, then it says there is no evidence that they were seized.  Which is it?   02:27 28 Jul 2003 (UTC)
Of course the companies were siezed.  It is common knowledge and it is well documented.  I'm going to revert that disclaimer.  16:45, Aug 28, 2003 (UTC)
 Now, there's no context at all to the seizures.  I don't think you have improved the article with your last edit.  Prescott Bush was not a Nazi collaborator, sympathizer, or anything of the sort, but it sure seems that way now.

I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.

I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a """"gut feeling"""" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of """"pattern"""" and bet based off of that, on the """"gut feeling"""" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any """"patterns"""" is purely coincidental.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

He lost his father at age 7 and was taken out of school to live at a village at age 8. He was beaten sensless by his tutor at age 10 and was taken out of his new school again. He failed to achieve cumulative average score for his favorite school he always dreamt of, at age 17. He was arrested when 24, interrogated for days and put in solitary cell confinement for two months. He was 25 when sent to exile. When his colleague associate and close friend that is one year older than him was declared a hero by the association that he was serving, nobody noted him. When he was fighting to save cities from foreign occupations at age 30, his hometown fell to the enemy. His superior lobbied for him to be sent away to get rid of him when he was 30. He was left idle at his new location and could not get paid for months. He was in a hospital in Vienna for renal treatment confined to a bed for months lonely when he was 37. When returned to work, the army he would command was disbanded. He was fired by the Minister of Defense at age 38. He owned no civilian clothes to wear, no money saved and had to borrow a coat from a friend. An arrest warrant was issued for him the same year. A death order was issued for him when 39. He became the President of the Turkish republic when he was 42. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk read 18 thousand volumes of books in which over 200 000 lines are highlighted. Tens of thousands of sidenotes were entered. When found with red weepy eyes, he said his only worry was burning eyes which he took care of yards of soft fabric he'd ordered by his side to dry his eyes. He put his signature under the biggest changes and revolutions of his time. His farewell was equally impressive and touching with the last words of ‘.. and peace be upon you..’ in the morning of November 10, 1938 when Turkey was just waking up.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Talk: WikiProject Comics 

In the interest of everyone who watches the page for ongoing discussions, please stop making irrelevant, minor changes to the page simply so that you can ramble in an edit summary. People watch that page in the interest of relevant discussion. Also, it appears that for a few days you added two paragraphs to the page that didn't add to the discussion, only to revert them. Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics is on the watchlist of numerous editors, so if you could stop crowding it with nonsense that would be nice. Cheers.   
It wasn't nonsense. A topic was brought up regarding the contents of a certain story arc, and since it extensively quoted my story, character archetypes, scenes, etcetera, I very honestly filled in what the thematics were, as I am chronically upfront and very impulsive, but also tend to rethink and fix things I do that might have been a bad idea.  
Some of the involved people (or at least Kurt Parker used some of their catchphreases regarding me, whereas I remember Joe Quesada mentioning that he considers """"Spidey"""" his favourite fan several years ago), censored it.  I do have a problem with that the ones responsible didn't just talk with me directly from the start and explain the situation clearly, rather than attacking, and then didn't even have the decency to actually stand for the very statistically unlikely yet real ridiculously extreme hate-tirade against me. I mean, I as good as always stand for anything I do, and it is all comparatively extremely trivial.  
Yet I've apparently got lots of western comics crossover, movies, tv series, computer games, books, and manga inexplicably focusing extensively on me in some kind of vendetta for a long time, which is extremely confusing for somebody literalminded with limited sensory filters like myself.  One obscure story to process and put horrible input I had been exposed to behind me (well, 30000 visits counts as obscure in my book), and almost completely random Wikipedia nad tvtropes edits somehow equalled a global media campaign reaching hundreds of millions, while declaring me a genocidal lunatic...  My """"does not compute blinkers"""" have gone haywire for quite a while now to say the least...   

That said, please quit doing it, regardless of what imaginary pop-culture vendetta you're talking about. If you can't control making edits that do nothing but serve as a soapbox, go somewhere else. Otherwise, it's like someone who can't control their bladder going to a water park. It just causes problems.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Question 

Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: """"They control our systems of information."""" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to """"prove"""" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'd like to clarify my concerns with the current version of the article, following the reversion of some of my edits by Stirling Newberry.

My general concern is that it doesn't accurately describe the debate about various causes of hyperinflation.  The article seems to me to be describing a stereotyped view of each side of the debate, which exagerrates the amount of controversy and obscures the amount of common ground.  """"Monetary"""" and """"Crisis of confidence"""" explanations of hyperinflation are describes as if they are two completely different competing theories,  held by different schools of thought (""""monetarists"""" and """"neo-liberals"""").

I think that the overwhelming majority of economists would see both monetary and confidence factors as being important as the initial 'root cause' of hyperinflation, with the importance varying from case to case.  A lot of the economics is very uncontroversial. For example:
It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position.
It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.

I would be interested to hear from Stirling what specific inaccuracies were in my edits, and why he deleted the statement """"The two models are closely related, and often economists may explain hyperinflation as being due to a combination of both effects.""""

 2.78 meters per second per second = m/s2 is likely low, but 3.70 is likely a bit high. 0.96 m/s2 is way low, as is 0.0945 for Earth. 0.96g might be correct for Earth's gravity in low Earth orbit, but it is likely a bit less, or it might be Earth's surface g at Earth's equator but likely that is a bit more.

501e2401a733eac4,""" issues, because these ones are unlikely to be resolved through discussion, and are usually very demanding on the MC members.

However, issues between users, such as Wik, Theresa, 172, VV etc... are typically issues that should go through mediation before going through arbitration.

It seems people are totally forgetting the procedure of dispute resolution as suggested some time ago. Arbitration is about punishment, mediation is a soft way to achieve dispute resolution between participants. It is a gentler way to resolve a conflict. And it is also meant to be more gentle on others participants as it is a private solution, which do not force users to see an ugly display of accusations, threats, insults and generally speaking attacks between users, as we can see these days here and on the mailing lists. 

I have a problem with this. The MC basically finds itself plagued by trolls, and good participants just plainly refuse mediation. So, how useful is the mediation committee ? 

I'd like to mention something. In real life, people are more willing to accept mediation because there is a cost to arbitration that does not exist with mediation. This cost is in particular that
 arbitration is a long process
 arbitration is costly
 arbitration is sometimes unfair

I wonder if any arbitration on Wikipedia should not have a *cost* to all those involved. Apart from very specific cases of troll handling, most conflicts between regular participants are *not* due to only one party. If arbitration was more costly, perhaps participants would be more willing to discuss first, before heading to punishement. Perhaps should they be a cost, whatever the outcome ? Perhaps should the decision taken by the AC more costly in case there was refusal to discuss ? 

I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include:
 Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  Once positions have been staked out, publicly and in permanent media, mediation is much more difficult.
 To be effective, mediators must have unimpeachable respect.  Real-world mediators are retired judges, former statesmen, former heads of corporations.  They are effective in part because they are perceived to have discretion, and balance.  The parties they serve believe they will act predictably and fairly.  The committee at present includes some members not known for this.  Moreover, Wikipedians as a rule do not extend """"unimpeachable respect"""" to much of anyone (due to the nature of the culture here).
 Mediation requests are presently public.  They should not be (c.f. MeatBall:GetARoom), since it leads to playing to the court.
 Process is """"not yet fully decided"""" (Wikipedia:Mediation Committee), which discourages people who could, potentially, be helped; indeed, the mediation-releated pages have an unfinished, essay-like feel to them overall.
 Some private discussion amongst the mediators themselves might help in this regard (GetARoom again), since it is more difficult to reach consensus in a MeatBall:fishbowl.  The WP community should get over its """"all discussions public and archived forever"""" fetish, which is disfunctional.  Consider the success of the IRC channel (which is more private than the wiki or the ML).
 There are inappropriately informal expectations of the mediators themselves (""""Mediators are independant in their choice of whose case to mediate, and how to mediate.""""  Wikipedia:Mediation Committee) while there are rigid and overbroad rules for those who they serve (""""You will then have to agree both on a mediator,"""" """"The mediator will check your motivation as regards mediation,""""
 It may be necessary to send some people to mediation.  I can think of several cases where contributors could, appropriately, be asked by the community to discontinue their edits to an article or group of articles until mediation is complete.  Lots of real-world success with this.
 We have a problem with some articles where carefully-crafted compromises are undone by editors who weren't involved in the original compromise, which prevents healing.  I know of no good way around this, but obseve that it is a barrier to successful mediation.

My concept appears to prevail in a few dozen articlesI have read.

The sentence you quote is absolutely neutral.  You just aren't familiar with the underlying theory of strike-back (e.g. submarines as employed in nuclear warfare) guiding the insurance, nor likely the three man cell structure that kept the IRA from being broken by the British.

There is a double standard in your edits.  If it comes from some US history book, like """"peace movement"""" or 'M.A.D.' as defined in 1950, you like it, even if the definition is totally useless in 2002 and only of historical interest.  

If it makes any even-obvious connection or implication from the language chosen in multiple profession-specific terms, you consider it somehow non-neutral...  Gandhi thinks """"eye for an eye"""" describes riots, death penalty, and war all at once, but you don't.  What do you know that Gandhi doesn't?

Guess what:  reality is not neutral.  Current use of terms is slightly more controversial.  Neutrality requires negotiation, and some willingness to learn.

This is your problem not mine.  You may dislike the writing, fine, that can be fixed.  But disregarding fundamental axioms of philosphy with names that recur in multiple phrases, or failing to make critical distinctions like 'insurance' versus 'assurance' versus 'ensurance' (which are made in one quote by an Air Force general in an in-context quote), is just a disservice to the reader.

If someone comes here to research a topic like MAD, they want some context, beyond history.

As an editor, you already know that RS is Wikipedia-editor shorthand for """"independent reliable source"""", as in WP:RS. Every statement made in a Wikipedia article, unless it is an obvious one like """"the sky is blue"""", should be WP:V verifiable (policy), meaning supported by independent WP:reliable sources (strong guideline). The more extraordinary the claim, the more reliable should be the sources. See also WP:VRS for a capsule summary. In other words, Wikipedia is not the authority which is speaking, the sources are. We paraphrase, quote, and cite them. What you wrote has not been explicitly discussed in the media (yet).
2nd point: we don't write about Wikipedia or internal matters unless independent reliable sources have done so; to do so again sets up WP (or an editor) as an authority. 
3rd point: See WP:BURDEN], which spells out that it is the duty of the adding editor to cite reliable sources supporting the claim.  If none exist, the claim must not be added to a Wikipedia article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Urantia Readers-Intl has hundreds of readers worldwide in places such as Denmark, Saudi Arabia, Europe, Korea, etc. Your self repressed reality is necessary for you to get through each day of your bitter resentful life.

 Editing problems Steer Wrestling 

Montanabw is making sweeping, unsourced statements - statements that he/she is presenting as """"facts that everyone knows, and thus need no sourcing"""".

I think Mbw's is approaching the subject with a proprietary bias and simply does not want a researched, documented """"Animal Abuse in Rodeo"""" controversy presented. Mbw is minimizing my contributions while maximizing his/hers. Mbw is very slightly altering my contributions to reflect a """"this is an animal nut"""" statement sort of thing. In one contribution I named a veterinarian with work in rodeo and included her credentials and her professional observations. Mbw reduced the contribution to """"a spokesman for an animal rights group."""" So how come you are supporting someone who is actually damaging the article, and coming down hard on someone who is trying to improve and cover all the bases in the discussion? You should be telling Mbw the same thing you are telling me  if you don't want your material to be heavily edited then don't contribute.

Nobody really attacked me before I revealed my age here.  After I announced that I was 14, I was subject to a constant storm of harassment and abuse.

The same thing goes for when I was on The Sandbox when I was 11.  Before people knew my age, they didn't care.  After I told them my age, they hated me.

The teenage posters here are typically the smartest ones.  Let's see... G-Dawg, Head_Banging_Brunette, ClassicAge, Metropolis (even though he's a bipolar weirdo), ChrisScript, just to name a few.

Whereas, most of the teenagers here are thoughtful, intelligent, mature, and often profound.  But they're subject to constant schoolyard bullying by the idiot adult posters who think they're somehow superior because they were born (and dropped on their head) earlier.

I don't understand why you want to spend so much time out of your life pretending that you're some sort of Wikipedia patrol officer.  Seems to me that pretty much all you do is tag other people's pages for deletion.  Seems to me it must be predicated on some sort of megalomania.

This whole charade about an encyclopedia that 'anyone can edit' is given the lie by chumps like you.  All I wanted to do was write a page about an author I'm interested in, but your arrogant and ignorant deletion of the start of that has put me off bothering with it again.

I noticed that when you tagged it for deletion you removed the very clear indication at the top that it was a beginning and that it needed development.  This meant that the next person who came along had no idea that there was more to follow.  Why didn't you just tag it as a stub?  Because you're so wrapped up in your pathetic power trip that you just wanted to alienate me?

And who are you to decide who's 'notable' and who isn't?  I figure anyone with a dozen published works (which is easily verifiable) is notworthy by any definition of the term  except, clearly, the subjective definition you store somewhere in your tiny brain.

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

 Really? 

YOU'RE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF! Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the """"evidence"""" you send me are considered.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

I checked the Wikiquote delete logs and didn't see a Carolla listing.  Are you sure the original link was always active?  

Absolutely.  It was in Wikiquote as """"Adam Carolla"""" and including both LOVELINE quotes and other show quotes.  I started it in 2002.  Others added to it.  Dozens of great jokes and """"Carollaisms.""""  As you can see on this bio page, the Wikiquote link is still at bottom of his own bio article.  Quotes were properly sourced.

—Preceding unsigned comment added by 198.189.141.254   

That sucks.  When was the last time you saw the page existing?  Maybe we can check the deletion logs specifically.  Is there a copy somewhere else?  Did you save a copy?  

Sure I know the quotes and could rebuild it.  What's the point?  The same turdmunch who vandalized and deleted it without explanation the first time will just delete it again.

I have, finally, decided to create a user-id for Wikipedia. I have gone through most of your edits and I have noticed that you are on of the most fundamentalist """"athiest"""" on Wikipedia. Your sole purpose to be on Wikipedia is to manipulate the WP guidelines and use them to your own benefit. You even have the audacity to create a list of web-sites which, in your point-of-view are not """"reliable"""" (Indeed, you use WP guidelines to clout your """"point-of-view""""). You are NOTHING but an agenda-pusher, egoistic bully. Having said that.. No, I don't assume """"good faith"""" in your edits because they are full of bias and hate. I will make sure that you get exposed on the internet.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0
8bfa74d39d515331,""":It's not a question of whether the fact should be included. It's a question of the emphasis being put on them.  Changing the section name doesn't fix the problem, unless you want to head it """"A random list of matches that implies nothing"""".  The difficulty is that someone has picked these matches out as having particular significance.  And in so doing they are voicing an opinion that they are significant, without any cite that says """"this was one of Sharapova's must notable matches"""".  And that's even before we consider the match analysis that goes along with it.

To give an extreme example to illustrate; what would you say if I was to create a section called """"Maria's Greatest Moment"""" and write about my favourite Sharapova match winning forehand smash (with a cite to a mention of the match).  All factual, but with an emphasis that is entirely my POV.  And even if we all agreed that, yes indeed, this was her greatest moment, it still would be entirely POV unsupported by reputable sources.  This """"Notable matches"""" is obviously not as blatant, but it's the same thing.

The only way to remove opinion from the picture is to establish a factual measure for a match's inclusion, and I don't think that's something that can be established as a precedence on one tennis article alone.  I'm not saying its a big problem.  But anyone assessing the quality of the article is likely to ask """"Whose opinion is it that these matches are so notable/significant/special/whatever that they deserve a special mention in a separate section?""""

Some other inaccuracies... or perhaps misconseptions is a better word... first, you assume that taking part in a war for independance is a violation of ones obligation... that is often a matter of interpretation.  To a Mason like George Washington, he was not being disloyal to England... rather he was upholding his obligation by being loyal to """"the country in which he lived""""... ie Virginia (and, later, America).  Second, You seem to assume that Masons were united in their opinions.  They were not.  In each of the conflicts you mention there were Masons on both sides... all of whom felt that they were living up to their obligations.  (Freemasonry was just as divided as the rest of society). Yes, today we celebrate those """"famous Masonic Leaders"""", Washington, Franklin and Handcock... that's because they won.  If the Americans had lost the war for independance you would probably read all about those """"famous Masonic Leaders"""": Bannister Tarlton, Phillip Skeen, and General Cornwallis.  As Lexicon says... you can not make the assumption that Freemasonry is involved in independance movements... only individual Freemasons.  Freemasonry is often """"involved"""" on both sides.

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,0,0,1,0,0,0

I've have, in the travels here on Wikipedia, stumbled across some accounts that had been banned, and in each case, the banning notice advise the banned of the lenght of time the ban would be in effect? If not improper, might I be told?

I edited a hidden note to clean it up and expand it in hopes it would then be better understood and accepted because, in the state it was in, it was jumbled and confusing (obviously, such things are IMO). Also, part of the message was put in a hidden note before the word in the principle article (“are”)  that was sought (by other before me) to be protected and to remain unchanged, and part of the hidden note’s message was put behind the word (“are”) in what is a separate hidden note, a factor I saw as being counter-productive, but concerning which I also had an idea in my mind as to why someone might want a word or two – but few words were best IMO  in the part before the word “are.”

Editor EscapeOrbit (the person I understand is claiming that he was threatened) now takes the position that that the hidden note that was edited was near perfect and doing a good job for the many weeks it had been there.EscapeOrbit, in his talk page comment of 14:42, 8 February 2010, wrote ’’”The facts are that this note has been on this article in one fashion or another for some while. . .I believe it is doing the job intended.”’’ http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Queen_(band)&diff;=next&oldid;=342616216  However, the same EscapeOrbit on January 20, 2010, on the talk page for Queen, said ‘’“The ‘were’/’are’ ‘’{please note: this is the same ‘are’ in the principal article mentioned in my paragraph above} ‘’in the lead  and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.”’’ Please see the full entry in context in the footnotes, where you can see EscapeOrbit is saying this in response to another reader’s encouragement to improve the article so it can be nominated as a Good Article candidate.”I've put in this article for a peer review so that we can analyze what we need to do to improve it. In the next few days I intend to nominate this article as a 'Good Article' candidate, however I feel ‘’’work still needs to be done.’’ I will be making ‘’’major improvements’’’ to the history segment of the article, I feel we also need to develop a Further Reading section and add a lot more citations throughout the article. ‘’’Any contributions, no matter how small, would be sincerely appreciated.’’’ Let's do Freddie proud and get this to Featured Article status. TheStig 
I fear you'll not get very far with a GA nomination while there is still near constant edit warring over whether Queen still exist or not. ‘’’The """"were""""/""""are"""" in the lead and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.’’’ Is there no where we can get a definite answer that can be cited on this? Escape Orbit   {emphasis added} or the page itself if you prefer. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Queen_(band)#Nationality

The hidden message was, by EscapeOrbit’s own words, having no good effect. We had a written encouragement to improve the article so it could be submitted as a GA candidate (see footnotes). With my edit of 16:43, 7 February 2010,  I included this edit summary: ‘’“expand existing important note with new footnote, both to hopefully have it be more widely accepted, resulting in lesser need to keep reverting these same few words.’’http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen_(band)&diff;=342506929&oldid;=342389811 The “important note” I addressed in my edit summary is the hidden note concerning the “are.” The purpose, intent, and actual effect was an improvement in the hidden message.

EscapeOrbit’s reason for wanting the language he wants in the hidden note, in spite of the fact that it is not working at all to slow the daily changes to the words in the principle article that we actually both seek to have preserved, is that he personally identifies himself with the phraseology and is on a quest to be personally responsible for having (what are, in his opinion – and interestingly enough I don’t disagree here) British subject matters use British English. He writes about this phrasing, precious to him, that it is ‘’”It is similar to a note that ‘’’I frequently attach to British musical band's articles” ‘’’ ’’ {emphasis added}. He is overly invested in defending the phrasing that by his own statement is not have a positive effect. The problem is that he has posted “frequently” and so, like a beloved child, even though he says it’s not working, he isn’t about to have anyone change his baby.

My changes to the hidden message are those words in bold: “are DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO IS OR WERE. 'Are' is the correct UK ‘’’primary compulsory education reading level’’’",0,0,0,0,0,0

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1,0,0,0,0,0

So the question is should we do that or leave it and polish areas of the article through copy editing?

As for Delta/Triangle (sorry, I don't know how to make triangles on my keyboard), I concluded at the time that he was a newbie for the reasons I mentioned above. It was an explanation of my perception at the time, and not some type of value judgment. But if you really want an answer to your question, I'd say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community.

""""If you believe images should be retained without there being a rationale for that use present..."""" Thank you for making it clear that you either are not reading my messages, or are being deliberately churlish. I didn't say anything about images being retained without a rationale. I already explained clearly above the matter regarding the rationale, and if you're either too illiterate or too lazy to read and comprehend this, then perhaps you should not engage me in discussion.

I made the edit summary that I thought was appropriate, as I'm quite tired of obnoxious deletionists like Triangle who make false accusations and no attempt to communicate with others, as well as persistent liars like yourself who think repeatedly putting words in other people's mouths constitutes """"discussion"""".

The fact that they perhaps build on earlier pagan traditions, very likely common within the whole Germanic area, is merely interesting.

As for my source, I would still say that self identification based on research is much more legitimate than anything you can come up with. Quoting one sentence from the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs Webbpage, based on some junior civil servants (webb-editors?) personal opinion, is not more legitimate than creative interpretation of a Swedish medical study (which actually does'nt support your claim).  

Selective quoting out of context in fact seems to be your speciality, regardless of the source. Besides the portion of text you quote regarding a small area of Swedish Finland, you did notice the bold text that forms the summary of the text?

The area is generally unchanged since the great middle-age migration that carried Swedish settlers to the uninhabited coastal areas of Finland).

As for the paragraph on movemement that you quote a part of, it concludes with: """"Flyttning över den (språkgränsen) har förekommit i alla tider, men har blivit en företeelse i stor skala först i vår tid"""" (Movement over the language-border has taken place in all times, but has become a large scale phonomenon only in our time).

Your comparison to Ireland is interesting and in your mind perhaps even relevant. The Irish situation is however different, e.g. the English occupation actively surpressed the Irish language, culture and heritage. Something similar did not take place in Finland. In fact the Finnish language was actively developed and promoted by Finland Swedes (initially due to academic interest and in the 19th century as a bulwark against Russification).

Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that. Every Jew who survived the war in Poland is a Holocaust survivor and it does not matter if he managed to survive Auschwitz, Cracow Ghetto or by hiding in the forest. They all survived that hell, so did Polanski.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, first let me say that if you have any questions about wiki-formatting, just drop me a line, and I'll be happy to help. As for the glossary, I think there's a better way. Remember, as an encyclopedia, it would be better to have articles about each of the terms, and then put the terms into a category so they would all be grouped together. So I think the best way to go would be to start writing articles about the wedding terms. This way you could do each of the terms justice instead of trying to sum them in up in a sentence or two. Finally, as for saving the material, you're free to copy and paste the page to a sandbox so nothing is lost. Best, XMan

Tony Sidaway is a confirmed and vocal scientologist who often writes lengthy usenet posts describing his involvement with the church of scientology and extolling its virtues. Excellent and accomplished example of a bureaucratic fuck, Tony spends hours lurking on IRC under his favorite nick of Sherilyn Sideway to have cyber sex with unsuspecting guys.

On wikipedia there was a fake aspie and Tony Sidaway banned him.  Tony gives his reasons for banning: 
 """"I have blocked this editor becausae he's stupid"""" (spelling error preserved) 
 """"he's an obvious nutter ...  Let's just tell him to fuck off."""" 
 """"He's a troll. Our only appropriate words to him are """"fuck off."""" 
 """"I sincerely suggest that """"fuck off"""" is almost too kind for this pernicious and stupid troll."""" 
 """"I don't bother with hngs who ask m or f. I always IRC as Sherilyn and sometimes netsex as male, sometimes as female. What the hell, it's just roleplay, and I have always played female in MUGs. What really pisses me off is when some guy asks m or f or decides to check out my IRCNAME (Tony Sidaway) _halfway thru_. If real gender means that much to him he shouldn't be doing """"virtual"""" sex in the first place. There are hundreds of real women walking around outside, looking for real sex."""" —Tony Sidaway 

Routinely, other bureaucratic fucks on wikipedia have blocked Tony. (log of blocks)

He also blocks others for reasons like """"Idiot"""", """"Particularly stupid troll"""" and an admin for """"Persistently flaunting a stupidly large signature with multiple image inclusions.""""

He also harasses banned users by reverting anything they write on their talk pages and protecting it simply by saying, """"they attempted to use their talk page.""""   Note: other wikipedia admins do this abuse, too.

He bans anyone who says the slightest thing even vaguely related to criticizing something even vaguely related to an admin.  He also hides what they say (example).

I'd appreciate learning your views, for instance, your reasons for wanting this particular name, and what alternative username you might accept that avoids raising this concern.

 We can talk about it, here. 
 You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.
 Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.

If we can't resolve this on our own, we can ask for help through Wikipedia's dispute resolution process, such as requesting comments from other Wikipedians.  Wikipedia administrators usually abide by agreements reached through this process.      ♦ ♣ ♠ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

For the record, this Indian boy is a troll or was trolling for fire (BR, this reminds me of OH-6 flying low deliberately to draw for enemy fire), look at his comment and you'll see. Note that I have a very low tolerance for trolls and vandal, so as such I have been the target of such imbeciles from the start of my wiki-career. BR is well aware and can vouch for me that I have a secret-admirer/stalker/impostor out there who would actually stalk and harass those editor(s) who harass me while imposting as me, what I'm doing is nothing less than trying to deflect that from the Indian boy should he carry on with harassing me and then getting that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor to latch on his tail instead. Yes, I may have been a wee bit mad at that moment when I commented to him but I'm not stupid. Him, on the other hand, is just plain stupid for going down that path until eventually that secret-admirer/stalker/impostor reacts to him. What are we to do then? Lastly, the Indian boy had actually picked a very convenient date (end of our one month mutual interaction ban) to revert my edit so I'm fully entitled to be mad at him for being an moronic/insensitive jerk, especially at the condescending tone in his edit summary during that particular revert. Tell me now, does it take two hands or one to clap?

Top credit it would seem is working on the Witness series for Al Jazeera English. I can't find a site that ties him to the programme, but one special was nominated for an International Emmy. However, he certainly wasn't the producer of that one, at least according to (what appears to me to be) their website here.

 Removed genetics attack subsection 

I removed the entire following attack subsection from the """"Genetics"""" section:

===Clarification===

It is clear from the graphs contained in the 2012 Turkish Cat Genetics Study that the majority of the Turkish Angora samples submitted show only minor traces of the original Ankara Zoo cats.  Ankara Zoo sample No 9575 shows a 72.14% signature mistakenly referred to as the Cyprus group since it is also common to many Cyprus cats—whereas the Turkish Angoras of the cat fancy  show a generally insignificant but widely variable percentage this critical identifying signature. Other examples from Turkey that show these signatures are 13558, 76.77%,  and   9702, 97.02%.  Supposed samples from Turkey that matched the cat fancy Angoras cannot be verified or confirmed. In fact, the supposed authors of those samples deny any knowledge of them.
Considering that these """"scientific studies"""" from the genetics laboratory of Leslie Lyons of UC Davis assume that American Turkish Angoras are the authentic Turkish Angoras, as her website says, then cats that differ from those samples are not Turkish Angoras. This is highly flawed and misleading pseudo-science, which breeders may consider genetic proof.
Please note that the 2012 Turkish Cat Genetics Study was neither published nor is available on a webpage but consists only of an e-mail with attached graphs sent to interested Turkish cat breeders. Further details and citations may be obtainable at.-  http://www.turkishangoracat.org/arastirma.aspx?arastirmaId=1

2250ebe3581ef161,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

Thanks for your intervention on this page.  I agree you're probably right to remove the lengthy footnote, but my reason for supporting your removal of the reference would be different, namely that as time goes by some information loses its topical interest and becomes more abstruse (which is, I imagine, the reason it was placed in a footnote and not in the body of the text in the first place).  I therefore appreciate your placing the information on the talk page, for you never know, a serious researcher rather than just a casual visitor who takes a general interest in primary legislation may derive genuine satisfaction in finding it there; the very distinction, I hope you will agree, that marks an encyclopaedia (which should be an extensive knowledge resource) apart from a penny guide-book.  A few points however:
You have left some external links (Blair, Kelly) which had relevance to the detailed former footnote but not to the article.
There is a balance between referencing all statements and introducing clutter.  
The bullet-point statements are accurate (and, in point of fact can be verified easily enough by looking at the linked pages).  And as to technology, if you have a way to put a reference on a footnote using the edit pages, then you are a lot cleverer than I am.
Your criticism is a little disparaging.  It may of course be both accurate and justified, but pejorative language such as yours is quite difficult to read with a constructive attitude.  Perhaps it needs charity?

 Two birds, one stone 
Dear 206.186.8.130... I have been quite content to leave Dyukov described as a historian Novosti, the state news agency, trots out to dispute Baltic lies about history. (One of several of my edits deleted, each replaced by a more strident defense of Dyukov's credentials.) Given Dyukov's command of basic facts is worse than the factual improprieties he alleges in the film, he already commands far too much space devoted to his views. However, since English-speaking viewersto whom this encyclopedia is targetedget to see Dyukov quite often on """"Russia Today"""" (Novosti's version of CNN or the BBC News), I'm supportive of leaving his commentary in (other editors have mass deleted it). Dyukov's spokesmanship as a historian """"specializing"""" in Soviet history and in debunking, in particular, Baltic """"myths"""" (he uses stronger words in his Novosti interviews) is notable whether I like it or not. However, his POV and role in the official Russian (not independent) media must remain in the article for his presence in the article to be understood and defended.
   As for my """"principles"""", they are to representing the parties and their relationships to their establishments accurately. It's obviously simpler to delete undiscussed POV anonymous IP edits as vandalism if they have no reasonable basis in actuality. But whether you register or not, whether you choose to reveal yourself or not, any edit that portrays Dyukov as a reputable historian and ignores his incestuous relationship with the Russian state media agency will continue to be deleted as totally POV.
   Your tone of questions communicates to me a wish to be blunt. I'll be happy to oblige. Writing that Dyukov is a """"professional historian"""" here and that he isn't should be discussed elsewhere amounts to nothing but asking the editors here to ignore facts and to lie under the pretext of """"NPOV."""" —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Your accusations are false and malicious. You hurl accusations to justify your attempt to enhance POV editing in the article. There has indeed been bullying on the article but it has been directed AT me, not by me. You are obviously looking at this is a very biased manner. You punish Wikid for making a joke about a swine that offended The Magnificent Clean-Keeper. Yet, you punish me when I complain about horrible words being directed at me, including the repeated use of the """"F"""" word by The Magnificent Clean-Keeper towards me. There has been a great deal of harassment directed towards me, yet you totally ignore it or never looked into it. Then you make the totally false charge that I  misused mediation. That is outrageous. The mediator turned out to have a srong bias. He could not fulfill the role of an impartial mediator, in my opinion. To say that rejecting a mediator who had openly expressed a strong bias is wrongful is just more bias on your part. I agree that Wikipedia is not an advocacy site, and that is the exact point I have tried to make. BOTH sides of the murder mystery need to be included but since you have blocked both editors on the same side and encouraged the others to remove ALL of our work, it will hardly be a surprise when this article reads like the prosecutor's brief. But to me the worst part is to see the condoning of abuse of a woman editor. That is so sickening it is beyond what I am willing to tolerate, even to try to help achieve NPOV in an article.

At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, """"pedophile trolling,"""" which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship.  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a """"personal attack,"""" and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.

Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are """"copyright violations"""", even though Wikipedia is filled with """"fair use"""" pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs.  Mr. Berry is a news story.  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article.

Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.

In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.

Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Naming conventions
Manual of StylePlease bear these points in mind while editing Wikipedia:
 Respect copyrights – do not copy and paste text or images directly from other websites.
 Maintain a neutral point of view – this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
 Take particular care while adding biographical material about a  living person to any Wikipedia page. Particularly, controversial and negative statements should be referenced to multiple reliable sources.
 No edit warring and sockpuppetry.
 If you are testing, please use the Sandbox to [ do so].
 Do not add troublesome content to any article, such as: copyrighted text, libel, advertising or promotional messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Deliberately adding such content or otherwise editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism, doing so will result your account or IP being blocked from editing.
 Lastly, if you are editing an article about an individual or group of people, please adhere to Wikipedia's Biography of Living Persons' policy.The Wikipedia Tutorial is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia. If you have any questions, see the help pages, add a question to the village pump or ask me on . By the way, you can sign your name on Talk and discussion pages using four tildes, like this: ~~~~ (the software will replace them with your signature and the date). Again, welcome!

Mistake in vandalism reversal

I reverse the changes also added to the article by the unsigned individual. There is some content here that might be worth retaining and incorporating into the article. 
However, 
 the same individual also removed my comments from the talk page. This amounts to censorship and suggests at minimum bad faith in regard to the wikipedia process of revising articles.
 the new content was a quick cut and paste from some previous text as shown by the fact the section left its original references at the end and a """"summary"""". As I noted above not all this new material is inappropriate.

By the way, the exercise physiology wikipedia article was mentioned in the Guardian today by a friend as an example of the problems of creating encyclopedia articles on wikipedia.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Remove – Entire article is of questionable notability. There also appears to be an agenda here, being pushed, often through tag-team and uncivil retorts, on this talk page. Wiki seems to turn more into 4chan and less from an encyclopedia through the manipulation of """"not censored"""" rhetoric, each day. I'm waiting for a photo of a """"sheep shagger"""" to appear on Welsh or Scottish article, under the guise of """"notability"""". Some editors here have serious pro-gay COI/POV issues and need to step back, especially given that this is supposedly a heterosexual activity also and straight people are being accused of """"homophobia"""" out of turn. Why is the solo female fister a cartoon, and the male fister a photo, for a start? Not very neutral. Why does there even need to be a photo, when all the article needs is a description – I mean, it's hardly rocket science, and that guy hardly has a """"rocket"""" worth shouting about? You don't need a photo on how to boil eggs, so why one here? Again, it's anti-Wiki content that brings the entire project into disrepute with regards to making it less accessible to kids, more agenda/politically motivated, more pornographic, less educational, detrimental to every other article/contributor who wants to see Wiki develop. Sadly, it is forced issues like this that lead to conflicts regarding discrimination. Gays complaining about homophobia if the photo is removed are hypocrites, when they themselves use """"not censored"""" as an excuse to discriminate against younger readers. Age discrimination is no less prevalent than sexuality discrimination. Photos such as this are what lead to the Foundation considering an """"image filter"""" recently. I'm pro-LGB (-T) but I also believe in """"behind closed doors"""". And I disagree with anyone who says kids won't look it up. When I was young kids looked """"dirty words"""" up in the dictionary. Now the internet is here, and images like this only serve to corrupt young minds. Let's put it this way: because of """"no legal threats"""", no LGBT members stand a chance of forcing a legal discrimination matter out of this.

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

I made a note about this on the 1-11 talk page but maybe you didn't see it.

They used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when I was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over, though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy!

848c2815fb66508c,"""write on this article and based it's new look on the point guard article. Any comments? S | talk 

This page has improved greatly in terms of content. I feel, having read it, that I understand the essential skills of a shooting guard, as well as bonus skills, the way a shooting guard fits into a typical play, etc. Now the page needs some work on grammar and style. This sentence, for instance, is odd:

""""Shooting guards can be known for excelling at certain skills that shooting guards should be able to exhibit.""""

Well, of course. At the very least a player should master the skill set for his or her position, no? If this sentence is meant (as I believe it is, judging from the awkward sentence fragment that immediately follows in the paragraph) to introduce a discussion of players who are particularly known for mastering the shooting guard skill set (as opposed, say, to being all-around good players who just happen to be physically suited for the shooting guard position), then I suggest changing the sentence to say just that: """"Certain shooting guards are particularly known for mastering the shooting guard skill set (as opposed, say to being all-around good players who just happen to be physically suited for the shooting guard position)"""". Then I would begin the next sentence with the words, """"Such shooting guards include . . ."""" The phrase """"such as"""", which starts the sentence at present, is appropriate to a subordinate clause, not a full sentence. 

Allen Iverson
Should a.i. be on the list of notable shooting guards?  He listed as a pg, but he more of a shooting guard. 
Of course he should. He's a combo guard.

being able to dunk in an athletic high flying manner such as Michael Jordan or being able to throw it down with reasonable strength such as Jason Richardson.
same thing?

Sasha Vujacic....
Should this guy be listed among the rest? I think not. Please remove him from the list.

The list of 2 guards who are known for attacking the rim is laughably inaccurate.  Allan Houston was a pure jump shooter. Ben Gordon never goes all the way to the rim on his drives. He pulls up for floaters and jump shots well before the rim.  McGrady and Carter attacked earlier in their careers, but are now constantly criticized by league analysts for being too passive. They are mostly jump shooters now.  Jason Richardson is a great dunker but I would certainly not put him on this list either. He drives to the rim far less than he shoots.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)

Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

I have to agree with Alecmonroy: A > B is no different than B > A.

The immediately afterwards mention responses to those criticisms.    Then go onto the next, and so on.  What seems most important to me is how neutrally the prose goes from one to the next.

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.

That was a mistake. A momentary lapse of reason. I'd somehow got it into my head that somehow, someway, just the slightest degree of sensibility would kick in. I'd forgotten that logic has no place here.

Clio basically told Dirk he doesn't know shit, and so I basically parrotted that back to her in order to try to point out to you guys once again for the zillionth time that you're letting her get away with murder.

And then came the ugliness. I'd forgotten about the whole thing until just now when I noticed in my contributions that I'd apparently made a remark on her page. Talk about a personal attack. I swear I've rarely seen such sickening thoughts put into words. And all about me. Such anger, such twisted hatred, such disturbed imagery...

No. I don't care how irritating this whole thing is. It's not worth it. This girl is not well, and NEITHER of us are helping. Haven't you noticed how many regulars have simply stopped editing out of frustration? Haven't you noticed how pretty much every question is answered by the same person? Do you not realize how responsibile you are for having actively participated in the transformation of the Humanities RefDesk from once being a vibrant place where one could find a multifaceted, multidimensional answer written by a variety of differing editors, each with his own invaluable unique insights and perspectives, into the stale, single-faceted unidimensional, useless place it is now?

No. It's not worth it. It's futile. Worse actually. Perhaps I share in some of the blame myself. If it wasn't for my relentless protestations, perhaps the whole thing would have blown over, Clio would have gotten bored of the Humanities RefDesk, moved on, and it wouldn't be the cold, sterile place it is now.

Perhaps I lost perspective, and didn't realize the magnitude of the harm that my persistent challenges could potentially inflict on a very fragile and terribly imbalanced young mind.

Just please read the damn thing over, Rockpocket. Here it is:  . Those rants of hers are clearly not the product of a healthy mind. I recognize that now. I have to stop. What I'm doing is wrong. So to all who will inevitably read this, I say publicly to Clio:

You win. I lose. You're right. I'm wrong. You're smart and you were right all along, I'm an intellectually impoverished imbecile. Yes, as you say, I'm pathetic. I'm honestly, genuinely sorry for having caused you such grief. I don't belong editing here on Wikipedia as I can't even approach your level of intelligence.

Re edit warring, seems you and other admins aren't looking into the matter for more than 30 seconds.  Seems unfair.  Could you read the following?  It concerns my 1 sentence addition to the article on {Chad Kellogg].  1 sentence, 1 source. I tried at length to discuss the matter in the Talk page.  MONGO made abrupt, final decisions without any discussion, nor without any other editor's input.  He deleted everything I added within minutes, did not leave room for discussion, ignored my Talk page discussion, removed all of my POV templates, did not wait for other editors to take part.  In particular, he removed my 1 sentence 1 source (Outside Magazine) addition to the article, and cited only personal reasons, rather than objective reasons, which is why I did the POV templates.  The reason for blocking me was that I stated he committed """"Vandalism"""".  I stated """"potential Vandalism"""".  I'm new to wikipedia and it seemed he was unilaterally vandalizing a perfectly good 1 sentence and 1 national magazine article.  Seems MONGO was edit warring.  Could you review my simple addition to the article, and review whether he was committing vandalism, etc?  Seems no one is assessing his conduct, and is placing all blame on me.

Sherlock has been brilliant and I love the jokes about Mycroft's weight. Speaking of Mark Gatiss who would have thought that one of The League of Gentleman zanies would be doing so many interesting things today. That also means that I should mention his one time colleague Steve Pemberton's WhiteChapel series. While not necessarily up there with some of our favorites it has had some interesting moments.

 Some tips for you! 

Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

For more help and tips on that subject, see user:chzz/help/refs.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

Obvious deductions are not original research.  This includes simple logical deductions. For example, if A is in district B, and district B is in province C, then A is in province C. This is a simple syllogism. Included are all of the other simple deductions. It is an obvious deduction that Lea's Shield is the same class of device as the FemCap.
Identifying synonymous terms, and collecting related information under a common heading is also part of writing an encyclopedia. Reliable sources do not always use consistent terminology, and it is sometimes necessary to determine when two sources are calling the same thing by different names. This does not require a third source to state this explicitly, as long as the conclusion is obvious from the context of the sources. U.K. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer to multiple devices available in that country .  Many older U.S. sources use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the Prentif device (here effectiveness results for Prentif are labeled only """"cervical cap"""").  A few current U.S. sources (such as those cited by David) use the term """"cervical cap"""" to refer exclusively to the FemCap device.  Some U.S. sources include the Lea's Shield under the cervical cap umbrella.  These are obviously inconsistencies in terminology, and they can be resolved by the judgment and consensus of editors on Wikipedia.
Although the English language version of a source should be used when it is published in multiple languages, foreign language sources are also welcome, and even encouraged to reduce systemic bias. Non-English sources identify the Lea's Shield as a cervical cap.
Sources may be written in a fictional, nationalistic, religious or other narrow context. Material from these sources incorporated in Wikipedia must be placed in a broader, more encyclopedic context. Placing material in an encyclopedic context is different from taking things out of context. For example... material written from a localized or nationalistic perspective must be presented in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint... This is not original research when good editorial judgment is used. Taking material from the U.S. - where only one cervical cap (first Prentif, then later FemCap) was available for many decades, and so """"cervical cap"""" is synonymous with a single device - and presenting it in a perspective consistent with a world-wide viewpoint where multiple cervical caps are available at the same time, and so the definition of cervical cap is broader and includes Lea's Shield, is allowed and even encouraged on Wikipedia.

I am not attached to the title of """"cervical cap"""" for this article.  I believe the best editorial decision would be to merge Lea's Shield into this article, but, like David and Una, I am open to looking for a new name.  Anon, are you willing to consider a merge with a name change?  If so, we can discuss alternatives to """"cervical barrier"""", which you have objected to. Talk     C

MarshalN20 response
Dear AGK, thank you very much for the note you left on my talk page. I am currently busy with work & studies to provide a thorough response, so I will provide a quick list:
Lecen submitted the RfM yesterday (from my side of the world). About a day has passed, and yet the user has been frantically badgering people with demands of action (, , , and ). His distraught actions hold no more common sense than a squirrel looking for a nut.
Lecen incorrectly claims that I am a user """"involved"""" in the dispute. My only contributions to the article include a copy-edit of the lead () and a reversion of Lecen's vandalism ().
The dispute itself is between Lecen and Cambalachero. I am a third party to the dispute. Lecen claims that I am not a third party because I am in favor of Cambalachero's point of view.
The people in the Dispute Resolution Noticeboard were mostly (if not all) against Lecen. He conveniently tries to ignore these things, but I think it would be good to make a list of them here:
Go Phightins (Mediator, ): """"I advocated your position [MarshalN20] and refuted his [Lecen], for the most part, in the DRN.""""
Amadscientist (commentator, ): """"[M]y intitial concern is balance by Lecen. The editor seems to have more than a less than disinterested POV on the subject and it does certainly show in the editors remarks, posts and requests. The first source I found is also the first source prsented in the Third Opinion and appears terribly cherry picked.""""
Binksternet (commentator, ): """"Use WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV to name those who say Rosas was a dictator, and to name those who say he was something else. I don't think it is fruitful to demand that historians be found who say directly 'Rosas was not a dictator'.""""
Wdford (commentator, ): """"It seems to me just from this thread that a number of sources do not regard Rosas as a dictator. On that basis alone, I feel we should have a statement that """"some see him as a dictator and others as something else"""". [...] I would recommend that we therefore mention that both opinions exist re Rosas, and hopefully the article contains enough background as to let the reader understand both perspectives in his original historical context.""""
Based on all this points, I see no need for any further mediation. Plenty of third opinions have already been provided (including my own) to the dispute between between Lecen and Cambalachero. Lecen asked for third opinions, he got them, and yet continues to game the system looking for someone to agree with him. I kindly request you, AGK, to please stop Lecen from WP:GAMING the system.

 Irgendwer=Alfrem? 

After reviewing the archive of this talk page, I'm pretty sure Irgendwer is a sockpuppet of , who has already been banned from this article ArbCom for trying to remove the phrase """"political philosophy"""" from the lead.. Both are obviously less than fluent in English, appear to enjoy addressing others as """"troll,"""" and have a tendency to say """"kindergarten"""" when especially annoyed by opposition to their edits. I have filed a request for CheckUser here.  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

When people are losing arguments to maintain their majority POV, they may change to denunciation and enforced law. This is exactly the sense of libertarianism not to be political.  

Do you deny that you are Alfrem?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Alfrem is obvisously a dead account. So your question makes no sense. But it makes clearly sense that you are a troll.  

I'm asking if you are the same person who edited under the account Alfrem. Yes or no?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Well, well, well.  You're quite the detecive, rehpotsirhc!  This is from Alfrem's talk page:

====Alfrem banned from Libertarianism====
Enacted on 19:58, July 13, 2005 (UTC)  

 Pending resolution of this matter  is banned from editing of Libertarianism. It shall be presumed that any user, such as  who makes Alfrem's trademark edit, removal of the phrase """"Libertarianism is a political philosophy,"""" from the article is a sockpuppet of Alfrem. Such sockpuppets may be banned indefinitely if practical.

According to this, it seems like  should be banned indefinitely if practical...   

Are you the Great Dictator?  

No.  Just extraplating from what was said about you earlier.  And, by the way, there is nothing unlibertarian about banning someone from a libertarian community who cannot abide by the rules designed to protect everyone's rights within that community.   For example, being refused entrance to a tie-required restaurant - for lack of wearing a tie - is consistent with libertarianism.   

 about me? Denunciation! Not even your term of sockpuppet is correct. And, by the way, you describe Wikipedia as your property but it is used as political public good.  

When you can spare 5 free min. within your dictatorship, you may deliver about the old question:
What is your concrete evidence that libertarianism must be described in its characteristic feature as """"political""""?
 

What would be an example if such evidence, if it were possible? You've already dismissed appeals to logic, highlighting of the prima facie indefinsibility of your position, and links from across pretty much the entirety of Western civilization. You don't even understand half of what is said here. Do you want a photograph? A mathematical proof? You made up your mind along time ago and won't listen to any other opinions. Now, are you Alfrem or not?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Yes, I am convinced that Irgendwer is Alfrem. They are both German, and they use similar mannerisms such as referring to libertarianism as """"L."""", """"kindergarten"""", etc. They make similar grammatical errors.

 Deletion of a lot of Content at Colligo_Contributor 

Hi Tnxman307,

I wanted to ask about the deletion of a ton of content at the Colligo contributor page. I think you labelled this as spam and removed the majority of content on the page then suspended my account """"colligo"""". That's why I'm now posting under my IP address.

A couple of quick things. Yes, I am the CEO of colligo and did an update to the article. I did it openly under the colligo ID which is used rarely to make changes to the article. Occasionally we will make minor changes to correct misinformation (as you can see in the change I made). It is the duty of the company to police misinformation on wikipedia and elsewhere, but I assure you we are not spammers, nor do we intend to provide misinformation or post """"advertisements"""" on Wikipedia. We respect the spirit of posting from a neutral point of view.

The page was actually started in 2007 and went through quite a bit of back and forth before it was finally accepted. Actually, the sections you deleted were accepted in 2007 after much debate. As far as I can tell, the changes made over the last few years were merely additions to the same type of information originally accepted (features and capabilities of the product, press articles etc.). There was very littl hyperbole (if any) in the posting.

Originally the debate centred around whether the page was actually """"neutral"""" and """"notable"""". Some reviewers argued for it and some against. There were some concerns raised that some of the original content was contributed by the company itself. In the end the page was kept (as you can see) as the consensus was that, although the company had contributed, the material was factually accurate and presented from a neutral point of view, so that was OK.

I can provide many examples of pages that are structured similarly. In fact, the model page that was used for the article was http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Groove. The sections in this article are very similar to the ones posted on the Colligo Contributor article (which are now deleted).

Tnxman307, I'd like to appeal to you to put the material back up on the page and reinstate my account. As you can see, I don't post often and rarely make changes to the Contributor page. I understand that you and your colleagues at wikipedia are trying to keep it as a neutral and authoritative source of unbiased information. I applaud this! I am hoping that upon review, you will see that the changes made to the article were not biased or """"spammy"""", simply statements of fact.

Thank you,

Barry  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 76.77.70.92   

Also, in considering my account for deletion, please note that I posted elsewhere, including creating the page on Black Hen Music, a music label with which I have no affliation.

Thanks for your consideration.

I reviewed the Colligo article and the material that was removed. The material I removed was not supported by reliable sources.

Also there are a number of new valid architecture categories based on NRIS architecture categories which could be added, such as Category:Early Commercial architecture, Category:Bungalow/Craftsman architecture, Category:Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals architecture, and Category:Late 19th and Early 20th Century American Movements architecture, that i have been sharing about at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject National Register of Historic Places#new NRHP-specific architecture categories where Ebyabe also shared.

I bet others would have suggestions/requests, too, if you let others know you might do some updating.  Your tools have been tremendously useful to me and to others.

About previous stuff, what I understand mostly is that you have not liked me or others generating minimal stub articles, unless a certain threshold of development or need is met, a threshold that you set differently than i have.  I don't want to re-open anything like an argument, but I wonder if you think list-articles i've been working on recently are good or bad.  These are about fraternal organization buildings (List of Odd Fellows buildings and others linked in its See also section), and also List of YMCA buildings and List of YWCA buildings.  I think they serve a good purpose, broadly, like the NRHP-listed bridge lists do, and I have chosen to develop them and to open stub articles for all their entries up front.  I think this rapid development approach has headed off a lot of misunderstandings that woulda been generated if they were shorter lists or had many redlinks.  I think i've had a lot more cumulative experience now, good and bad, with dealing with disambiguation- or Masonic- or Connecticut- or other-focused editor groups, and I think that rapidly generating the articles works a lot better, often, than leaving open red-links.  It certainly helps in establishing good categories right away, and also I've seen/learned the need for the architectural categories that correspond to these kinds of buildings.  Doing all of a certain type, at once, seems beneficial.  You can comment or not, but I just thought you might be less miffed about my going ahead with a lot of article generation, if you considered the pretty-good, immediately stable list-articles of these sort that I've been making.

Thank you for your welcoming remarks on my talk page (talk). 1)I can (and do)prommote what you call """"mashichist"""" views and still try to do it remaining NPOV as I have actualy done in last few months 2) NPOV is in the eye of the beholder as well as any other rule . See for example the Gil Student's page deletion proccess to view examples of extreme bias against him by some of the Chabad WikiPedians and their attempts to hide that bias by quoting the WikiPedia  rules. Or see the reverts of the Chabad page and the Rebbes page by various people and some of the things they posted on the corresponding talk pages to """"prove"""" the """"anti-mashichist"""" agenda or """"anti-mashichist"""" """"domination"""" of the """"official Chabad""""

It is difficult to explain how the environment, racial bias, etc. could explain these consistent differences which show up all across the world.  Rushton continues this line and says that there are other traits which differ between groups.  He dichotimizes it into 3 races to make a point.  He could as easily done it with 4, 5, 6 , 7 or infinite races.  As humans we need to categorize things because that is the only way we can make sense of the world.  Technically every organism in the world could in theory be it's own """"race"""" since everyone differs slightly from the next.  No two creatures are exactly alike (for the most part).  Putting things into categories is arbitrary because every living thing is related to each other by differing degrees.  Fish, birds, mammals etc. all had a common ancestor and are all related to each other by varying degrees.  It is only in the human mind that there are clear demarcations between anything.  However, in the real world these differences are meaningful to us and categorization is necessary.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

TABThe recent antics (Nanook Vandalism etc.) preformed by this anonymous user (216.164.203.90) were preformed on purpose, as a part of an experiment.  I am currently writing to you from my place of work, located in Boston, Mass, USA.  I have chosen to perform this unorthodox experiment from my workplace, in order to avoid negative votes on my possible upcoming election as an administrator, on the Wikipedia username I use from home.  The main purpose of this experiment was to know, first hand, what vandalism “feels like,” from the vandals’ point of view.  Let me tell you, “I have learned a lot” 
TABI appreciate how you all quickly reverted vandalism and left welcoming warning messages in the beginning.  When I continued to vandalize “Wolf” I appreciated how you all “Assumed Good Faith.”  However, Kim van der Linde, at times you forgot to stay “As cool as a cucumber.”  I especially admired Radio Kirk’s reaction and cool persistence with the block he initiated.  His direct quoting of the complaints of others was a smart move.  I also liked how you all continually to welcome me to Wikipedia even though I was annoying the ^&%$ out of you.  
TABSo, to recap, the recent problems caused by than account were done on purpose, as an experiment by me, in order to find better ways of combating vandalism with my other Wikipedia account.  I thank you all for you response and for now I’m signing out.  If anyone else uses the ip to access Wikipedia in the future, please regard them as a new user, as I don’t plan on using my work computer to access Wikipedia in the future.

Larry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offer
in terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blocked
by trolls and their pet admins for making the effort.

""""Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. 

But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. 

The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) 

I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. 

Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to """"work with"""" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). 

This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. 

This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. 

It will probably be objected by some that, since I am not 100% committed to the most radical sort of openness, I do not understand why the project that I founded works: it works, I will be told, precisely because it is radically openeven anarchical. 

I know, of course, that Wikipedia works because it is radically open. I recognized that as soon as anyone; indeed, it was part of the original plan. But I firmly disagree with the notion that that Wikipedia-fert",0,0,0,0,0,0

 polyandry in Tibet 

Hi there. On 30 September 2005 you made a number of significant additions to this article, which have survived to this day, or would have, save for my undoing them:
Marcus S. Goldstein, whom you introduced to the text by explicit wiwilink as quoted here, as well as further described with his birth and death years in parentheses that followed, is not the Goldstein in question. The correct anthropologist is Melvyn C. Goldstein, born 1938, current co-director of The Center for Research on Tibet at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.
At least your addition of the characterization of polyandry in Tybet as being """"exceedingly rare"""" presently is, I'm sorry to say, unsupported by literature available already in 2001: See the PhD dissertation linked in its entirety from the Center's web archive of publications and other work on polyandry and family. 
I have corrected some of the above and made significant fixes in the Sources section, and  in the Polish-language version I prepared, the factual content reads correctly. The English-language version is still in need of attention, especially the inclusion of text documenting the revival of polyandry in Tibet de facto, which took place after communes fell by the wayside in China, and is blooming today, despite recent campaigns by the Chinese authorities to implement population control in rural Tibet from 1996 on. I'd like to see you redeem some of those earlier unfortunate and long-persisting mistakes of yore by lending a hand in bringing this article to a higher level of quality. Even careful copyeditting would be of help. Best wishes,  talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

dpkg Authorship

 Summary 

The discussion is about the authorship of dpkg. dpkg as it stands is a C program with well over 100 contributors.

The anonymous user at 86.176.68.157 claims that the transition from its Perl predecessor to a C program (which was done by the subject of this article) was merely """"porting"""" from one language to another, analogous to translating a novel. I’m not aware of any reference having been provided for this view.

The other view is that the C version was a substantially new program with a much greater feature set. This view is supported by dpkg's own AUTHORS file, which lists the subject of this article as its original author, and describes it as """"based on"""" the Perl version - not merely translated or ported from it.

It's obvious from the revision history that the subject of the page, or their agents/supporters are determined to excise all perceived criticism & connection with adware/malware etc... also that more than one other party is keen to see that those 'facts' are left in place.

In the interests of resolving the dispute - can we discuss why say Intego.com or thesafemac.com might not be considered reliable sources & thus their opinions worth mentioning ?.

Also, it might be considered here, that a web-search for 'Genieo' produces 100's of results asking for help in removing the Genieo 'adware', 'virus' 'malware' etc. Regardless of the company intentions, it seems clear that many users, & 'experts' too, see their products in a poor light, and that  should not be hidden from anyone seeking information at wikipedia... doubly so when the are verifiable & reliable sources for those points of view.

I feel that the company or their puppets are likely to continue reverting/vandalizing - and that the topic requires some sort of protection.

 More clean up and questions 

I think the first paragraph in early childhood needs a bit of a rewrite. I propose """"Muhammad was born about the year 570[8] and his birthday is believed to be in the month of Rabi' al-awwal.[44] He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, part of the Quraysh tribe, and was one of Mecca's prominent families; although it appears the clan was less prosperous during Muhammad's early lifetime.[14][45] Tradition places the year of Muhammad's birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca by the Aksumite king Abraha who supplemented his army with elephants. Alternatively some 20th century scholars have suggested different years, such as 568 or 569.[47]"""". Thoughts?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Incest 

I am pleased to hear you also dislike incest. This is not a personal opinion however. In the course of my research at Oxford University I can see clearly how sickening and harmful it is. This is no more a personal opinion """"the earth is flat"""". Does the fact that some people do believe the earth is flat make it a matter of opinion? Of course not. The harmful effects of incest are directly observable in exactly the same way. I think we need a third party opinion on this.

 Let's Clarify Something here 

First of all, nice to meet you Stephanie Adams. I to am a very well known celebrity, I just in fact was almost a winner for a daytime Emmy award (but that's neither here nor there)

I think what the big confusion is about Wikipedia is that it is verifiable information, not what you WANT on your wikipedia article.

Meaning, awhile back your website sold tarot card readings via email, we can all see that looking at the cached version of it. Maybe you do not do that anymore but your company DID in fact do it. Therefore since Wikipedia is a historicaly piece of work, it should be listed. Maybe instead you could add in """"Used to.... but does not anymore""""

I used to dance with Hula Hoops on stage. I do not anymore. But if a person put on my Wikipedia Article, """"Julianna Mauriello used to dance with hula hoops on stage"""" then I could not mark that as non factual and write on wikipedia that it is not true. So for that reason, since I can see that your website USED to sell Tarot readings via email, I am going to revert it but also comment it to show that you no longer DO tarot card readings.

Because interracial rape is now overwhelmingly black on white, it has become difficult to do research on it or to find relevant statistics. The FBI keeps very detailed national records on crime, but the way it presents rape data obscures the racial element rather than clarifies it. Dr. William Wilbanks, a criminologist at Florida International University, had to sift carefully through the data to find that in 1988 there were 9,406 cases of black-on-white rape and fewer than ten cases of white-on-black rape.

So we have the referenced materials for the Marquis de Lafayette, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, etc. and then your retraction.  I think this talk page is out of date or something.  In any event please update the talk page with the next actions.  

Change the aforementioned pages to reflect only the given name and change the subject of this talk session to be the same.  Would you say that is correct?

You know, it does, as I ponder it, make a great deal more sense to use the name and the various titles held in peerage, or otherwise under the person's given name.  There are tons of examples in every direction.  

So I see a basic three tiered approach.  The Person Document > The Honorary Title Document such as Baron, Duke, Knight, etc.? with iiluminating text in a section such as ===Early Life=== or perhaps ===Nobility Titles=== or something along those lines.  I enjoy refining documents to be more clear and include the """"much"""" additional insights found on Wikipedia and link to them.  

I await your direction on how to proceed.

The idea that one can distinguish the 'thesis' and 'theory' of intelligent design is puzzling. While I don't have access to Jones' Encyclopedia of Religion, there's an entry from 2003 (listed as 'forthcoming') on Dembski's list of writings on ID. Note that this is pre-Kitzmiller, and is typical of Dembski's writings of the time - Sagan, Paley and Kant. Assuming that this is substantially similar to the final version, there's nothing about thesis vs. theory.
Beyond this, John Carter appears to misunderstand the idea of """"theory"""". There are I think perhaps several other areas of what might be called """"theoretical biology,"""" such as parts of astrobiology, which also have a total lack of any hard evidence to indicate that they even have something real to study, in that case alien life. No. That's not what theoretical biology is. Take a look at the TOC of the Journal of Theoretical Biology. Or try Acta Biotheoretica. Or even check out the journal Astrobiology. Theory isn't about """"things that lack total evidence"""". 
This entire section about 'thesis' vs. 'theory' of intelligent design appears to be based on both a misunderstanding of what Dembski was saying (pre-Kitzmiller, when he was predicting the overthrow of """"materialistic"""" science and a department of ID at a major university within a decade) and a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference of what constitutes theoretical biology, and how it differs from unfounded speculation and science fiction.

 DeCausa, your pissing me off. First of all I have provided many different sources, I didn't just use Kurdistanica.

Because you did the same with the sources on the Kurdish language.

 * two siblings witness the death of their parents/mother's boyfriend at the hands of one of them, and the whole scene is preternaturally captured by a mirror
 * this happens after one of the siblings had been chained/tied up in their bedroom by the victims, then freed by the other sibling
 * years later the murderous sibling (in both cases the brother) is still psychologically scarred by the event
 * and murders and unnatural phenomena arising from the ghost-catching mirror and its shards ensue.

Victorian Station Master's Academy for Wiki Editors

Victorian Station Masters Academy
Founded 1839

Greetings Prospective Station Masters.
This course leads to an SM Degree.

At Victorian Station Masters Academy rigorous training for a position with a great future (but anchored firmly in the past) awaits you.

We will train you to be a respected Station Master (SM) in the time-honored tradition of being an unimaginative SM who unduly emphasizes minutiae in the presentation or use of his knowledge, and can narrowly, stodgily, and often ostentatiously show how learned they are.

Our graduates learn all the basics a great Station Master must master.
You will be taught to be dull, ill-natured, and ill-humored, and narrowly inflexible in standards of conduct. The public expects this.

A Station Master must be Self Righteous, convinced of his own righteousness especially in contrast with the actions and beliefs of others and narrow-mindedly moralistic.

You will learn to be:
Hidebound, extremely old-fashioned, tedious, tiresome because of the length or dullness of your prognostications, pompously Victorian, slow in perception or sensibility, and lacking brilliance or luster.
Our graduates are renowned for having an inflexible and ultraconservative character.

We offer advanced classes in arrogance, imperiousness, and special workshops to practice irritably sullen and churlish mood and manner. 

Learn an imperious manner marked by arrogant assurance, so as to exercise arbitrary or overbearing control over and tyrannize subordinates.   
All Station Masters are taught to be MASTERFUL. When you graduate, you will have the ability to act authoritatively with an obstinate determination to enforce one's will.

Our graduates typify the moral standards, attitudes, and conduct of the age of Victoria. You will take pride in being a stuffy and hypocritical representative figure of the Victorian era.  

Applications to register for the Class of 2006 are available at all train stations during normal business hours.

""""Station Masters always know their station in life."""" 

========================
Jack,
Now you know where they get their training.

The distinction between UT and ET is not sharp. Basically Q-Level Metric Engineering is UT. We can get there fairly soon. I am not willing to wait another 200 years.

Sure, but as a physicist I really am curious how it all works in principle. I think I now understand how. Let me try to make the idea as simple as possible, without making it simpler than is possible.

Cipher of Genesis (Carlo Suares, Paris, 1973)
Pre-inflation unstable false-vacuum is pretty much like the massless vacuum Puthoff & Co are currently stuck in leading them nowhere.

Phase transition to our universe, one of an infinity, forms the giant local vacuum wave AKA Higgs field. The fabric of space-time is the FM modulation of the Goldstone Phase of this Tsunami inside the post-inflationary vacuum starting off in the hot Big Bang as per orthodox theory. The dark zero point energy comes from the AM modulation of the Higgs field and is in two universal forms one repulsive and on attractive. On the large scale ~ 73& of vacuum is repulsive, 23% attractive. We are only a tiny % of total after you subtract off the hydrogen-helium gas clouds of proto-star stuff.

Metric engineering of WWD & Wormhole is simply getting a Josephson type effect phase-lock to the macro-quantum vacuum phase.

B(x) = (hG/c^3)^1/2'd'(Vacuum Phase - Control Phase)

The local invariant scalar metric field is of the form

g(x) = (1 + B(x))(Flat Space Time)(1 + B(x)) = guv(x)dx^udx^v

This section is disorganized and somewhat confusing.

For the moment, I will not be researching any new information or adding citations. I will average ranged values (i.e. 21-33% becomes 27%) and omit sources that have no value until they can be provided at a later date (these are grain-fed cows milk, spirulina, okra and castor oil).

I will also change the title of this section to 'Dietary Sources'; 'Food' is too vague.

 Dear Helladios can you stop deleting my input. You have no right to censore someone elses opinion. You are not God. Napoleon Zervas his behaviour was questionable and important for the prosecution of the people

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed in Gumenica, 626 persons were killed in Margellic and Parga. There were hundreds of other missing persons. In the same period, as a result of Greek massacres, acts of robbery and rapes against the Albanian population of Chameria; 2900 young and old men, 214 women, 96 children were massacred, 745 women were raped, 76 women abducted, 32 children, younger than 3 years were massacred, 68 villages were razed to the ground, 5800 houses and places of worship were burned dow",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Silent Consensus About Reality 

This phrase stopped me dead in my tracks:

...silent consensus about reality.

Perhaps the phrase """"silent consensus about reality"""" has a clear meaning in the jargon of some school of thought, but I have never encountered it before and have no idea what it refers to.  I'd like to see this re-written or expanded so that it's comprehensible by the average person (or removed altogether).  Since I have no idea what it means I'm not able to re-write or expand it, and I'm loathe to just delete it since it has survived many other edits and therefore presumably means something to others.  

The phrase was added by Special:Contributions/85.127.205.253 85.127.205.253 at 2009-01-31T03:27:25.  Can that person clarify what they intended to say?  Can anyone else offer an explanation?

WE ALWAYS get shotgun. WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you. WE are always first in line. WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you. WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off. This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY. And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT. 

No one here will ever like you. WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done?

  Are you fing kidding me? There are 30+ reliable sources listed in the pre-vandalism history of the page. This debate in this talk page has no importance and will not receive justice. I am making my objections public for the sake of posterity alone. If you want to see the sources:

 Go look at the history of the page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the history of the talk page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30+ sources are extensively discussed and analyzed, and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of """"reliable"""" which you have not familiarized yourself with. 

This debate has already been done and it's very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs; the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page. Without an """"admin in my pocket"""" my claims fall on deaf ears; I understand this all too well. If you or your allies were interested in due process, you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated. Your kind will always demand that others do all the work even when it has been done in exhaustive detail. When you've read this entire page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Law_of_One then you may speak without embarassing yourself. Anyone who has not read that entire page and understood the poles of the debate speaks from ignorance and exposes themselves as lazy deleters happy to erase hours and hours of work without a care.

I would just like to note that I do not see why my last comment was deleted, Charles. (Nor indeed why the comment by Jess was deleted). 

This entry was being vandalised by somebody who describes Hari as a """"little tyke"""" and was abusing other commenters by accusing them of being impostors. Given the opportunity to prove these people were not impostors, he refused. I was only pointing this out, so it can be borne in mind in future if this person continues to try to vandalise this entry.

How can responding to personal abuse with calm, reasoned arguments like this be described as itself personal abuse?

I totally understand why you are keen to shut down the nasty sniping that was becoming common here, but I don't think that's achieved by silencing people who are trying to point out personality-motivated vandalism so it too can be stopped.

Please don't just delete this message; it's really important to put down a polite, civilised marker about this. I think there is a strong case, once somebody has started abusing the subject of an entry in odd ways and abusing literally everybody else who edits it, to ban them from contributing further. To instead ban anybody who raises this question seems perverse. I think we should discuss it in a calm way, that doesn't accuse anybody of being a mysterious impostor or make any personal attacks.

Scott reconsidered and after picking up a blues riff, a new arrangement emerged, apparently with added piano work from Peter Bardens. Engineer Bill Farley modulated the sound and Morrison provided one of his most expressive vocals."""" pp. 137-138 Rogan, Van Morrison: No Surrender.

The Pepsi Rock Band Video category's official rules, on the other hand, do explicitly mention the moonmen: """"GRAND PRIZE: One (1) Grand Prize will be awarded to each registered Band Member (Entrant and up to nine (9) registered Band Members) of the Grand Prize Winning Video consisting of a trip to the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and receipt of a MTV VMA Moonman statue (the """"Grand Prize"""")."""" .

off-hand comment by Ludwigs2
The problem here, brangifer, and the thing that (as an academic) annoys me the most, is that you are doing something that no scholar would ever do.  You are starting from a pre-defined judgement (i.e., that anything not-science is bad) and working your way backwards to find supporting evidence for that position.  One can always find someone reputable, somewhere, who says what one already believes - ufologists do that all the time, cherry-picking quotes from scientists and government agencies -  but it's bad scholarship to do so.  You want so desperately to believe that the scientific community agrees with your radically skeptical position that you're grasping at straws.  That's not the way things are done.

be110535c0aa1691,"""Well, yes. Sorry, as a non-expert, non-German speaker (like most English-speaking Wiki readers), these two powerful ships - as equipped - were less than battleships (for whatever reason), and were not intended to be used as such by the Kriegsmarine. They were, I suggest, intended to see off cruiser escorts and destroy convoys. To me, to call them """"battleships"""" is confusing - they were not the equal of the """"Bismarcks"""" nor even of the """"KG5s"""". They certainly had the capability to be upgraded to """"proper"""" battleships, it was a design feature and, I think, work did start on the Gneisenau. 

I accept that the German term """"Schlachtkreuzer"""" translates directly into """"battleship"""", so what? This is the English language Wiki and should convey meaning to English speakers. """"Battlecruisers"""" were at a disadvantage to """"battleships"""": see Hood and Scharnhorst - and to me, that's the point. Perhaps English/ German understandings of the term have diverged, and it's a language issue. After all the Graf Spee, Scheer and Lutzow/ Deutschland have had differing descriptions in English (""""pocket battleship"""" or """"heavy cruiser"""") and German (""""panzerschiff"""").

I had thought that the accepted way forward was to explain the differing views, when appropriate.

Lastly, I object to the insinuation (perhaps not a serious one) that, because expert(?) comments on one side of the debate are not right here, the debates that have been carried on elsewhere (above, below and elsewhere) can be ignored.

The previous comment makes several incorrect statements about Baybayin's status as a script, the origin of its name, and what """"Sanskrit"""" refers to. Baybayin is a single script, like Latin, Arabic or Devanagari in all their variations are single scripts. It is most definitely not a group or family of scripts; no separate """"Sulat Bisaya"""" ever existed, and authentic Kapampangan script was merely the most notable regional variant of Baybayin. There were no special regional variations despite the false impression given by inaccurately wirtten samples of Baybayin from various regions as written by foreigners not used to writing the letters correctly. Scott, Villamor and especially Santamaría have shown clearly that the handwriting of different people in the same region, even from the same document, shows moer differences than the so-called """"regional scripts"""" written in distorted handwriting by foreigners. Modern """"Kulitan"""" or """"Súlat Kapampangan"""" is the recent invention of one person who took a 19th century French visitor's interpretation of Baybayin letters as written in an unknown source or sources from Pampanga, and combined these with a structure derived from a combination of Kawi and Korean Han'gul. It is a modern constructed script with no relation to how it was actually written when it was used as part of daily life. The name Baybayin originated with Tagalog speakers, not the Spanish, who at first just called it """"sus letras"""" (their letters). Baybayin comes from a word that originally meant to put things in a sequence or a particular order.  Sanskrit is a language, not a script or group of scripts. All these facts can be checked in the existing literature. Anyone who wants to write an accurate article should consult at the very least Paul Morrow's web site """"Ang Baybayin"""", Santamaría's """"El """"Baybayin"""" en el archivo de Santo Tomas"""", Villamor's """"The Old Philippine Writing/La Antigua Escritura Filipina"""", and Marcilla y Martín's """"Estudio de los Antiguos Alfabetos Filipinos"""".

 Ward Churchill is Not An Indian 
I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all """"Eichmann's."""" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean?

Hi Malaka,

I'm new to Wikipedia (greek-Canadian) and have noticed a strong anti-Greek bias on several articles related to Macedonia. I've been having issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#This_anon_.28apparently_User:Crossthets.29.2C_is_an_apparent_POV_Pusher.2C_evidence_below

This is a difficult battle because I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?) 

Where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. I will check back here in a couple of days. Have courage. Regards 209.161.238.86",0,0,0,0,0,0

""""BLP continues to tout the idea of using these hydrinos in products like super good anti-corrosion coatings for ships. Great, in 20 years have they supplied any of this hydrino product to coating manufacturing?"""" If I understand correctly, Mills did not publicize hydrino hydrides until spring of 2004. That is less than 9 years ago. Also, consider that in addition to this discovery, they are also touting the more recent solid-fuel hydrino reactor as well as the CIHT fuel cell. Before all that was the discovery of plasma based systems. It is easy to see why this might 20 years or more to develop.
""""Or more simply have they done an experiment where they recover the water from their experiments that allegedly recover energy from water and keep using that water and notice as the build up hydrinos increases the ability of the water to supply energy declines?"""" They do not try to reform the water after taking the hydrogen out of it. In the CIHT cell design, once the hydrogen is used, the oxygen is incorporated in other oxygen species which serve various functions in the fuel cell. The ability for the water to supply energy declines the moment that energy is extracted from them, rendering them as """"non water"""". There are no indications in the paper that recombination of two hydrinos with one atom of oxygen will form """"water"""", or that further energy would be extracted by catalytic reaction of such """"water"""", nor is any importance placed upon trying to measure the amount of such """"water"""" as a separate item from normal H20. The interest here, primarily, is not the notion of """"recycling water"""" for further extraction of energy, but rather, the interest here is to allow the electron of hydrogen atoms to fall to lower fractional orbitals below ground state and allow that energy to be harness through an electrochemical fuel cell via absorption of energy by ions.'—Expert Sectioneer of Wikipedia86 = 19+9+14 + karma = 19+9+14 + talk """"My objection to the characterization of Rowan as an a source of independent research on BLP theories was at least partially based on this issue.

To my knowledge, Mills has not made it clear that two hydrinos could combine with an oxygen atom, and this is perhaps because the nature of them would be rather unclear at this time, thus not justifying and publication of claims regarding that issue. Any questions specifically about this probably have no solid answers at this time, so it would not be surprising if no information could be gathered that Rowan scientists asking these sorts of questions, because that would probably not be available until the questions have good answers.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy.

equity in export oriented firms, local employees in trade sensitive and
offshoring-capable sectors, and the unemployed.  Low inflation benefits
holders of fixed rate debt, business that export to the target country,
importers, employees who gain from offshoring, retired people on fixed pensions
and people with protected annuity like wages (academics, government employees,
and policy makers).  Low inflation therefore tends to favor rentiers -
increasing their wealth by boosting the purchasing power of their assets,
and transfers wealth away from debtors, owners of real estate,
owners of commodities, local import sensitive businesses, and the insecurely employed.

In theory, this could be corrected - restoring its neutrality (and Pareto improvement),
however transaction costs, moral hazard, information asymmetry and political 
resistance would make such wealth transfers grossly impractical.

To the extent that Monetary policy creates a known and predictable transfer
of wealth between a priori known counterparties, it is not a neutral economic tool 
and cannot be divorced from political considerations and preferred constituencies.

Furthermore, such constituencies will try to influence choice of monetary policy
targets - rentiers/creditors and pensioners will prefer tight monetary policy, 
debtors will prefer looser monetary policy, as will exporters and other participants
in (internationally)tradeable sectors of the economy, owners of commodities  
and real estate, and the precariously employed

If redistribution of wealth via such mechanisms has differential efficiency
impact and impacts the network of business formation and production within
and between trading nations, some monetary policy targets may also move
an economy away from an efficient frontier.

Moral Hazard of Monetary Policy Making Agents 

From a principal agent perspective, monetary policy makers face 
a personal moral hazard - since their compensation typically takes the
form of a secure fixed annuity.  This would incentivize them to favor
tight monetary policy - even at the expense of lower real GDP growth.
Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth inversely related
to the unemployment rate would create a moral hazard in favor of overly
loose monetary policy.  Compensation schemes that made their personal wealth 
contingent on real GDP growth may be more efficient by reducing their
overall moral hazard.",0,0,0,0,0,0

One Direction (commonly abbreviated as 1D) are an English-Irish pop boy band based in London, comprising Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Zayn Malik was formerly a member leaving the band on March 25th 2015. They signed with Simon Cowell's record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010. Propelled to international success by social media, One Direction's four albums, Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013) and Four (2014) broke records, topped charts in most major markets, and generated hit singles including """"What Makes You Beautiful"""", """"Live While We're Young"""", """"Story of My Life"""" and """"Steal My Girl"""".

Their achievements include five Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, and nineteen Teen Choice Awards out of nineteen nominations, among many others. According to Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment UK, One Direction represented a $50 million business empire by June 2012. They were proclaimed 2012's """"Top New Artist"""" by Billboard. According to the Sunday Times Rich List, by April 2013, they had an estimated personal combined wealth of £25 million ($41.2m) making them the second-wealthiest musicians in the UK under 30 years of age. In 2014, Forbes listed them the second-highest earning celebrities under 30, with the group earning an estimated $75 million from June 2013 to June 2014.""""Justin Bieber is Forbes' highest-earning celebrity under 30 pocketing $80m this year... which should just about cover his costly legal woes"""". Mail Online. Retrieved 25 November 2014

After the release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the U.S. Billboard 200 history to have their first four albums début at number one.{{cite news|",0,0,0,0,0,0

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen.

I think """"activist"""" is a fair factual description of some of Sotomayor's activities at Princeton and (to a lesser extent) at Yale, but without the context that is present later in the article, the sentence in the lede sort of leaps out, and suggests something quite different from what it turns out to be (i.e. sit-ins, protests, 60s-style """"activism,"""" militancy, that sort of thing).  That's not what you mean by the word in this context, but the reader won't know that before reading the full article, which is getting pretty long.  Also, it's not clear to me that this activism is important enough to make the lede anyway.  There's a lot of stuff in the article that's arguably more important than these particular episodes in her life (especially at Yale, where any activism really was a very small part of the story of her time there).  What do you think?  If you really wanted to keep this in the lede, perhaps the wording could be changed, e.g. """"She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools"""" or something like that.

Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...
...and only me is who was warned and blocked
Curious...
  

""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

Short of writing that article as well (which would be interesting but I have been trying to tackle Senecio and the article about the alkaloids (which can and should be greatly improved)).  I would rather keep spitting out new species pages and I am also looking for information for an article about Paul Klee's Senecio (painting) which are all related to the article about the alkaloids.

I didn't only cite the scriptures but also other sources that purports to tell what is the real story behind the origin of Gadhimai Festival (I didn't claim it as the sole truth either but it provided a food for thought). If, according to you that is original research, then everything is original research, won't you say? If not in the gadhimai festival article then where should we give a chance to Hinduism as a religion of non-violence? The article attributes all the animal killings of the festival to Hinduism. Isn't that a sufficient ground to shed light on the religion's actual position. Besides, the animal killings of the festival are associated to Hinduism but based on what? Isn't that an original research or a subject of personal opinion too? Thank you I await your reply.  (Talk?)

Of course Mr Shankbone did revert edits, significantly more than 4 times in 24 hours too!  The biggest difference is that each time I was trying to find something that would survive, but he went directly back to the same thing.  

And while it is true that everyone thinks their version is correct...  you will notice that I do not have a history of being concerned about that.

Wikipedia has a richly deserved reputation as a source of inaccurate information because of exactly that type of entry!

The statement was that it is dark in Barrow for """"a month or so"""" in winter.  In fact it is more that twice that long (67 days), and that is an easy to verify fact  See the references provided in the article. You can also check the edit history and find that at one time the article itself was not quite correct, and that I provided the correct facts and the reference.

I would also suggest that you read the discussion page for that article, as back in October others wanted it deleted, and I am the one who suggested waiting for awhile.  But I did then say that it eventually should be removed for the reasons the other person complained about.

Whatever, tomorrow is another day.  If you have no integrity and want to bully your way to victory, so be it.  I'm not going to stoop to quite that level.  But trust me that in the long run I think that article will be corrected.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It would seem a bit excessive to me, and i think someone in the discussions i linked to also thought so, but who knows? As long as webcitation.org is only archiving text and not photos/video (i don't know about the latter), given that Terabyte hard disks will become """"normal"""" within the next year or so, it wouldn't put much additional pressure on internet/computer resources to do this (collectively for all wikipedians) for a few hundred million cites and store it on just one single hard disk... Personally, i'll probably just try and see. You can probably make a mental note (or note on your user page) which journals have a habit of being volatile. Online newspapers from places with relatively weak internet access and less developed internet/GNU/linux communities (e.g. Iraq!) probably might be volatile in the sense that after a few years they will change software/hosting/URLs or go offline for whatever reason. Another point is that webcitation.org probably doesn't (yet) have a long term reputation. archive.org and arxiv.org have been around for a long time, arxiv.org has very solid institutional backing and a huge amount of mirroring. In any case, i don't see why anyone could complain if you archived every cited reference.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

2fcdda40a8ac992f,"I agree with you. I am a Chinese contributor to this site and I speak 3 Chinese vernaculars and 3 European languages and through some of the unreasonable Mandarinization imposed here, I feel how repressed non-native Mandarin speakers are by those apparently native speakers. Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes.

 Are you kidding me? What does this guy have to do to have somebody shoot across his bow, once?  Murder somebody? GabeMC is out of control!! This editor has insulted many editors repeatedly. He mispells user names repeatedly, to intimidate, accuses all opposers, of his idea, as socks, calls them trolls, charges them with harrassment and is generally abusive. He incites other users to drum up charges against """"his enemies"""" of this issue. He has been warned before for changing """"The"""" to """"the"""" in musical articles while his own launched medcom mediation is in progress, ebfore, and yet when his misbehaviour is pointed out in ANI he creates such a ruckess with sidetrack issues he gets away with more disruption and a blessing. He has had editors topic banned, adminstrators banned for a six month period and investigations into every editor that has ever disagreed with on this topic. He has disrupted many Beatles talk pages with his """"Straw Polls"""" simultaneously for the same the/The issue when he doesn't get the right support. He is currently edit warring with the exact same edit, as well as a few others in the Pink Floyd article after you appear to have gave him a bigger feather in his cap for exhibiting [WP:Battleground]] behaviour for my complaint of WP:3RR.  WTF? Has we developed a Prima Donna that is untouchable, no matter what behaviour he demonstrates? A further opposing editor of his just committed WP suicide with an indef block that he requested due to the same WP:admin garbage processes.

QuizzicalBee has been adding the sentence """"According to Chesler, the the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a U.S. citizen."""", Hurmata has been reverting this back to """"She reports that the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

We have one doctor who said Terri was watching him. And we have another doctor who said Terri was cortically blind. We can report those two facts as is. But no one has come out and judged that the autopsy report is right and Cheshire is wrong, so we cannot report that. Since Cheshire and Thogmartin are both doctors, we can't dismiss one out of hand over the other. They both qualify as """"expert testimony"""". If some plumber testified in court that Terri was watching him, then I think we could argue that we could take that out as incorrect information and rely on Thogmartin alone. But this is doctor-versus-doctor, and all we can do is report who said what. As it is now, Cheshire says Terri watched him, and then parenthesis point out the autopsy two weeks later says something different. So, the conflicting facts are present next to each other. That's all we can do and remain npov.  15:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Since I heaped praise upon ' for his balanced and non-extremist POV, it is only fair that I give ' credit for not pushing his POV, even though he doesn't appear to me to always abide by this high standard. In rebuttal to , below, I must point out that ALL doctors have an opinion, and while I admit that Cheshire did not examine Terri as much as some doctors, I must point out that:

# Cheshire examined Terri a heck of a lot more than WE did;
# Cheshire is a whole heck of a lot more qualified than WE are (even with my double major in the sciences, biology and chemical science -with honors); and, lastly,
# Any lack of examination on his part is NOT his fault, but the judges' fault (judges, plural possessive), and let's recap.
# Thogmartin and crew were reporting their opinions too.

Besides, Cheshire may NOT have been wrong when he said Terri """"looked"""" at him; Not only could she have turned and """"looked"""" at him by sound cues (3-D hearing depth perception by use of her ears, which were not in question), but also we have found examples in which people with half a brain (or less) have been very successful in life, thus raising the possibility that TERRI could have been able to see, think, feel, etc. (I give credit to other editors, like '''''' who were more resourceful at finding -and posting -examples of cases of """"half-brain, but aware and intelligent people,""""  which I've seen in passing on the Internet.

The converse is true also. I believe the medical literature has reported cases in which the brain looked fairly normal but the person was PVS.

This page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish, which simply need changing and then leaving alone.

I have now prepared an unbiased wiki article which I wish to place on here, knowing full well that 5 minutes later, the fools that wish to write things they know little about, or have a vested interest in making it appear that facts can be altered to suit their own quest to become CD, will desperately alter the content.  

The article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts.  People that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them.  But the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow.  3rd party discussion regarding Valor or Rozz should be eliminated in favour of the Christian Death Biography.

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY
&
Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.
Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. 

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.

1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.

1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.

In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.

Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't know what your reason is for adding the range (9.43%-70% muslim), but I don't think that lack of religious data is a good enough reason to manipulate the results of a separate survey and rely on outdated, informal, far from accurate data from Ottoman times.

b0f14bd87a4ade56,"Important clarification to add: Processor vs Core Microsoft definitions 

Page shall contain the exact definition of what a processor is, microsoftly speaking. Indeed, this concept is quite blur if we refer to the numerous pages from different Microsoft web sites.

For instance, at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsserver/evaluate/features/compare.mspx, we can find:
Windows 2003 Server Standard x64 R2 (64 bits):
- 4-way symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support

Other example for the same Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition at http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/64bit/x64/standard.mspx
- memory-bound applications that do not require more than four processors.
- supports up to 32 GB of RAM on 1- to 4-way servers.
- Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard x64 Edition supports up to four CPUs on one server)

If we refer to Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing, multiprocessor architecture or multicore processor are both SMP architecture. Thus, by speaking sometimes about 4 processors support, sometimes about 4-way SMP support, Microsoft confuses us all.
Coming to a Quadri 4-cores based server (16 SMP), this leads to go from a Standard edition (4 processors support) to a DataCenter edition (4x4=16 SMP support), thus raising the license price as for no less than +700%.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The article on Morphological analysis started out as a relatively simple reference to Zwicky’s ideas, a definition of the process, a few references and some external links. I did not initiate this, but whoever did referred to me and the Swedish Morphological Society. This was fine with me: I went in and added a few details which I though relevant to the subject, but more or less left things as they were.

Then, a Mr. I. Tjahyo Sarwono came along with some very complicated diagrams, rather poor English, misinterpretations and explicit errors (a parameter he mistakenly calls a value, and a value he calls a parameter). I am in despair over this, as I don’t want morphological analysis to get a bad name because of a sloppy Wikipedia article.

It might be possible to get permission, but there is no point in doing soa web site of this sort almost always is unsuitable for WP, because it is usually written as a press release, praising rather than describing the subject and containing material we would not include.  It is therefore always better to rewrite. 

Please never copy this way from an outside source again, and be absolutely certain that in everything you have previously written, there is not just no copying , but no Close paraphrase. If there is, rewrite that part from scratch, changing not just the words, but the arrangement into sentences and the sequence of ideas.  '''''' ( talk )",0,0,0,0,0,0

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son 

                That goal is not consensus among editors. But more importantly, inline citations for every fact are not an FA requirement; see WP:FA? section 1c. CMummert · talk

The Bakersfield Californian ^ | Feb 21 2007 | LEONEL MARTINEZ My catechism teacher, Sister Mary Lou Petrillo, was a smart and scrappy nun who drilled into us the basics of Catholicism without demeaning other Christian churches or religions. Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN.

Firstly, I am not fixated on, nor am I carrying on a dispute with, Epeefleche, and I certainly have no desire to get into any conflict with them. If you are not prepared to accept that then my posting any further unblock request would be pointless.For what it's worth, my attention was drawn to the article in question by additions made by Epeefleche to several golfer biographies which are on my watchlist. I first posted a message on Epeefleche's talk page explaining the minor changes I had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. I also explained the obvious issue I had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list, before posting on the article talk page. I do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way, and thought I had responded in a reasonable manner to all Epeefleche's comments, while trying to return the focus onto the article. I repeat, I do not wish to engage in any dispute or conflict with Epeefleche or any other contributor and that remains the case. I cannot be any clearer on that.I have acknowledged that I should not have engaged in repeated reverting, and I see how that could potentially inflame things even more than usual in this instance.Yes, my response to Greg L was over the top and I should have done as I usually do – don't click the save page button and just ignore it, but it's too late now. bigissue """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've added this, see Cat#Skin Think outside the box 

 Scientific classification 

It appears that the current use of F. silvestris catus as the main scientific name is the result of a somewhat misguided interpretation of developments in taxonomy. I propose it is changed back to F. catus. First, this is a continuation of a lot of past discussion; most recently:
/Archive 8#Species name, and
/Archive 8#Scientific name
This discussion seems to have petered out into inactivity. It was noted that publications had started using silvestris catus, but no such citations were given. The article in its current state (under #Scientific classification) cites ICZN opinion 2027. However, as was noted in the prior discussion, this is a misinterpretation of the ruling, which was specifically aimed at wild animals and did not affect domestic animals; see this note, specifically reading from """"This erroneous nomenclature"""" and the preceding paragraphs. ITIS was also cited in discussion. This clearly prefers catus as the conventional name, although it cites MWS in noting that silvestris is also a synonym.

It would therefore be much more NPOV to acknowledge F. catus as the usual name. If catus and silvestris are indeed the same species then this should be discussed under #Scientific classification. Currently, this section should have {{disputed-section|Scientific classification}} put on it, because its interpretation of the source is wrong. I would do this, but I'm a new user, so semi-protection is stopping me. It would be even better if somebody can provide a source explaining the equivalence; all the most cited, most reliable sources in this discussion so far have favoured F. catus.

Also, while this is still semi-protected, I'd like to point out that both inline citations of Mammal Species of the World should be removed. The first is uncalled for by WP:LEAD#Citations. The name """"cat"""" is common knowledge and is recognised by all 62 other references in the article body. The second deals with specific species names for cat breeds. MSW doesn't even mention these names, so it's unfair to synthesise from that that Wozencraft, let alone all feline biologists, does not support them. However, MSW is a useful reference, so I suggest moving the citation to external links, or a probably-needed """"Further reading"""" section.   
Works for me. My opinion last time was that we should go with whatever the reliable sources say and F. catus is now the accepted name, then so be it. ''''  {chat} 
MSW3 is the canonical listing of mammalian taxonomy. It uses Felis catus and notes there is some controversy. We should do the same. -  (talk) 
I view this with suspicion. If 's interpretation is true, then ITIS should not report the domestic dog as Canis lupus familiaris, and call Canis familiaris invalid.

21e1ed466c57e7fd,"To believe that early zoom lens designs of the sixties had and optical quality comparable to today's is ridiculous.  This ignores the progress on optical design of the past few decades. Early zoom designs typically consisted of three lens groups (convergent,divergent,convergent); the 2d group was fixed, and the 1st and 3rd groups were mobile.  Furthermore, the 1st and 3rd group were rigidly linked, so that a complex and difficult to manufacture non-linear cam-based group distance regulation mechanism wasn't needed.  The downside of the rigid linking was that such a design can limit optical aberrations only over a very limited focal length range.
The development of sophisticated complex non-linearly driven four-group based designs (focusing, variator, compensator, relay master) is a fairly recent phenomenon that has been enabled by the development of new optical design techniques, computation algorithms, manufacturing — e.g. lower cost aspherical lenses, numerical control machines to manufacture precise non-linear driving cams — and material science — e.g. glasses with anomalous dispersion characteristics.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Reference to Caduceus in Homer, Odyssey, V, 47-48

William K. Emerson, Encyclopedia of United States Army Insignia and Uniforms, University of Oklahoma Press, 1996, pp 181-182

""""The Medical Department adopted a 1-inch-high gilt caduceus […] as its insignia in 1902. For the service uniform, officers wore the device in bronze […]. The caduceus, two serpents intertwined on a winged staff, was carried by Mercury, the god of commerce. Shortly after the surgeon general announced the caduceus as the medical symbol, critics said it was not appropriate, even though the caduceus had been used intermittently as various US Army insignia, starting with the chevrons for hospital stewards in 1851. The debate was important because it was apparent to all of the officers that the insignia was to become the device for the expanding Medical Department. The critics were unhappy with the caduceus as the medical insignia, and they stated that the single serpent looped about a staff was properly associated with Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing.

""""The Army and Navy Register of 28 June 1902 noted the argument about the appropriate insignia. Giving the badge an unusual interpretation, the editor wrote of the caduceus: """"The rod represents power, the serpents stand for wisdom and the two wings imply dilligence and activity, qualities which are undoubtedly possessed by our Medical officers. The design, however, does not lend itself easily to a Corps emblem."""" The dispute over the appropriateness of a caduceus continued for many years but never flared into a raging controversy.

[…] [Lengthy quote from old journal here, defending caduceus as a sign of non-combatants used to establish neutrality, and hence appropriate for non-combatants on the field. The article in defense of the caduceus states that it was chosen for neutrality, not medicine, and points out that the majority of the medical corps personnel are not even doctors.]

""""The army influence in selecting the caduceus carried over to civilian physicians in the early 20th century, and many civilian medical personnel still use the caduceus as a symbol. Since World War II, many doctors have begun to display the Aesculapian staff. When the U.S. Air Force created a new medical insignia, it adopted the staff of Aesculapius, with a single serpent, as the device for medical personnel.""""

A.H. Burkitt, """"On Tradesmen's Signs of London"""" in: Journal of the British Archaeological Association, Volume 9, London, 1854,  pp 40-59

Article discusses tradesmen's signs in London that have for the most part fallen into disuse. Author discusses signs in use prior to the mid-18th century.

""""Of the heathen deities and their attributes we find Mercury, or his caduceus, appropriate in trade, as indicating expedition [travel for the purpose of business]. Esculapius, his Serpent and staff, or his cock, for professors of the healing art […]""""

Leslie S. Wilson, The Serpent Symbol in the Ancient Near East, 2001
Can't view this title, but it appears to deal with the putative babylonian origins of the caduceus in one section. Might use to balance against Frothingham/Ward claims.

Mark P. O. Morford, Robert J. Lenardon, Classical Mythology, 2007

""""Some are outraged that the caduceus as a symbol of commerce and even worse should be associated with medicine. (Hermes was also a god of dishonest eloquence and thievery.) Others suggest that Hermes' caduceus may today be as appropriate an emblem for medicine as the staff of Asclepius. After all, the important business of medicine grows ever more complex, with advertising essential for competitive marketing. So one medical doctor, Glenn W. Geelhoed, poses the dilemma: """"Each of us physicians may choose what the profession should mean, and [between two serpent symbols representing very competitive ideals] adopt a symbol that is appropriate to…"""" [Can't get page number or rest of quote through Google, page number also needed].

Luke Van Orden, MD, Where Have All The Healer's Gone?: A Doctor's Recovery Journey, Writers Advantage, 2002, p 129

""""The caduceus has been the official emblem of medicine for four centuries or more. For the ancient Greeks, the winged staff with two serpents entwined was the symbol of Hermes, messenger of the gods and conductor of souls to Hades. Hermes was also the god of travelers, merchants, music, luck, eloquence, cheats and thieves. The earlier Babylonians regarded serpent",0,0,0,0,0,0

He is a Jewish person right? He wanted to implode the buildings for a war on Islam. Secondly, there was a television tower on top of the World Trade Center - does that seem weird to you people? That was all done for capitalism, propaganda, scare tactics, exploitation and viewers? No one talks about that. The television agencies wanted them to blame Islam for good measure, because of oil.  Oil, television agencies, government power, and lobbyist, in a government operated building. This man who had made up 9/11 is Jewish… It was all over religions… Jews versus Islams… Now governmental Jews are in power again only because of this incident …
Just months before 9/11, there was over $3.4 trillion dollars financed to the city, and they agreed to this situation; however, he had gained profit from the victims, which he's at $7 billion (USD). He had knew about the asbestos before he had bought the World Trade Center in 1980's. Plus the towers of 2, 3, 4, and 7 - were over $10 billion (USD - with tax).

Hi Padma and Nat!
Padma, I can understand your desire and, frankly, I see that there is precedence for it.  At a prior instantiation of this dab page (here), there was in fact a header, """"In Buddhism."""" I also agree with Nat insomuch that I think there is merit in only making changes to articles when merited and I guess Nat is focusing us again on the merit of the inserted/reverted/inserted/reverted/inserted text.  I apologize then for my perhaps putting the cart before the horse.
I think the inserted text contains two significantly different types of information, so I'd like to explore their merits independently.  I'm gonna create two subheaders below to facilitate this.  (talk) 

 Bath, Batha, Tabaath 
The first inserted/reverted sentence reads:
In Islam, the Arabic text Bath, Batha and Tabaath is found in the Qu'ran 62:2 Sura Al-Jumua The Qu'ran, Sura 62:2 http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/quran/06201.htm and is believed to be refering to Buddha.Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg.1007

The (hidden) references are:
 The Qu'ran, Sura 62:2
 http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/quran/06201.htm
 Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg.1007

So, it appears to me that the reason that this sentence is pertinent to the word """"Buddha"""" is because it identifies a possible referent in the Qu'ran to the Buddha (or a buddha?).  Since this article is about definitions of the word """"Buddha"""" per se — and not about the historical/mythic Buddha or other buddhas — it seems to me that this sentence is inappropriate for this article.  It should go in the appropriate article (e.g., possibly Gautama Buddha or Buddhahood).  Right?  Does this make sense?  This dab page is about the word """"Buddha"""" and contains pointers to articles that then provide meanings to this word.  The above sentence alludes to the meaning of """"Buddha"""" as Gautama Buddha (or, again, perhaps Buddhahood, still not clear to me from the sentence -) ).  Perhaps in terms of semantic cohesion, it would best fit in Gautama Buddha in world religions?  What do y'all think?   (talk) 

 Buddha (Arabic) 
The second inserted/reverted sentence reads:
The origin of the word Buddha in Arabic is; of descent, or he roused him, and put into action. Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad

The (hidden) reference is:
4. Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad

Here this sentence does in fact provide a new instance of the word """"Buddha,"""" separate from the existing denotations (of Gautama Buddha, Buddhahood, Buddharupa, etc.).  I think the next question becomes whether or not every instantiation of this word is worthy of an entry on this WP dab page.  For example, I previously mentioned one prior suggestion, that an entry be identified as a noteworthy instance of the word in another reliable source, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Columbia Encyclopedia, dictionaries from Oxford University Press, etc.  Nat mentioned the matter of each entry on this dab page being associated with an individual WP article (e.g., Buddha Records, Buddha Air, etc.).  This sentence appears to fail to meet either of these suggested standards.  Perhaps if not worthy of an entry in the WP encyclopedia, might it be worth an entry in the Wiktionary (here)?  Does the need for encyclopedic significance make sense?  Thanks for your continued civil discourse,  (talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The same group of tandem editors from several years ago still try and control this article. They want to eliminate an article about one of the major social movements ... the group that started it. 
Wikipedia is known for special interest control and buddy editing. Its a pity and the reason a serious article on an important American group is being tried to be done away with by tandem editors that obviously object for some reason to the content. The past clearly shows the same team of tandem editors here.
Beagle and Johnphos are tandem editors as is Lawrencekhoo and Epipelagic... One of the most significant groups in American history and they want to get rid of the article. Its pathetic and shows the weakness of en. Wikipedia. Lawrencekhoo is a mainstream economist who ax grinds economic articles Google his name for his economic 'beliefs' Gino And fifle fool... it does not have a fucking thing to do with communism you dumb ass.

Your section on how to define area is as vague as most of your other articles. Area is easy to define: It is the product of two averages. Volume is not 'analogous' to area - whoever wrote this, needs to look up the word analogous. Volume is defined as the product of three averages. It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

A. CoolKoon doesn't understand the point of the proposal. Does this refer to the proposal as a whole, or to modification A? The point of """"A"""" is to make it clear to readers that the two names refer to the same place in different languages.
C. Battles of the Kingdom of Hungary wouldn't qualify as clearly Hungarian events, since other nationalities (within the KoH) would be involved in them. I rather meant Slovak or Hungarian cultural organisations etc. """"C"""" doesn't influence Slovak ministries, because they didn't exist before 1918. I don't see the relation between modification C and the NPOV policy, maybe CoolKoon can explain that. 
D. Whether Slovak names were used officially before 1918 is not the issue here. They were used by the Slovak speaking population of the places. The main issue is which names would be expected by the English language reader. Since the places are widely known in English under their modern Slovak names, it would be very strange not to mention the Slovak names at least once (if modern names are different from contemporary ones, this should be mentioned). 
E. Relevant alternative names can always be mentioned in the lead of the articles, according to WP:NCGN. I'm not sure whether everyone realises that """"E"""" actually reduces the number of articles in which the Hungarian names should be mentioned.  Talk

You are an atrocious liar, Bob Rayner. If I wrote in the value-form article I created that """"Thus, Marx aims to provide a brief morphology of the category of economic value as such, from the simplest forms to the money-form."""" that is perfectly accurate and neutral. Because that is in fact what it is. It is not controversial at all. By contrast, your arbitrary vandalism of other's texts has nothing to do with accuracy and neutrality, but with your own perceptions, biases and prejudices what is acceptable or preferable. You are fighting your own propaganda war in wikipedia, as shown exactly by what you deleted and added across time. That's bad, but what makes it worse is two things: the evidence is that you frequently have no real experience or competency with regard to the subjectmatter, and you provide no satisfactory explanations or discussions for cutting out very large parts of texts from articles written by others. I am therefore going to launch an arbitration procedure against you as soon as I get some time.

Regarding Yours and SatuSoro's Criticisms
Just wanted to speak with you on the whole Indonesian Civil War controversy. I'd just like to say: I'd be fine with a change in title. My chief concern is that the title be accurate and keeps to NPOV but does not gloss over the facts in the process. So long as a new title does not violate that, I'm not going to dig in my heels.

I bring this up because SatuSoro has accused me of being too possessive of this article and Suharto.

 Re: Patron Saints of Places 

I noticed on the Talk page two separate comments, going back a few years, that the page would be more user-friendly if the listing was according to Place. Accordingly I've been trying to re-sort the entries towards that end. I've been making the changes in what I hope are manageable bits, partly because it's very time-consuming and I don't want to lose anything(particularly the citations), and partly because I've been waiting for someone to object. (I take it from your welcomed feedback that I may proceed.)
As far as the other patron articles: In general, since an article on any individual saint would indicate their various areas of patronage, geographic and otherwise, I think the over-all listings would be better grouped by topic. However, those pages seem somewhat less pressing, because at least they are separated alphabetically, (whereas, I found the Places page a bit confusing ... particularly because a number of the historical """"places"""" are now known as something else). -I am going to see if I can find some images as well (unless there is a rule against images and lists).
-On another note, I was looking for a clean-up listing for the Saints portal, but the one I found dates back to 3/12/10. Is there a more current one somewhere? -(I noticed your comment on the WT:X talk page, and I would be interested in helping out a bit on Advent/Christmas content, if you like.) - appreciate the input.

0cf1ec305a1d306d,"Warning templates on other's reverts 

Sorry about that, but I find many editors revert without warning the perp.  What leads to me leaving a message on another editor's revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before I do.  Since I'm already on the History page, I look to see if a warning was added.  I generally try to wait a bit before Saving the warning, but, as I say, a lot of warnings would not be left if I just assumed reverting editors were going to leave one.

Incidentally, I sometimes get edit conflicts on a perp's Talk page from an editor warning on a different instance of vandalism (sometimes even to the same page) some of them crank out the garbage edits at an amazing rate.  Anyway, sorry if it puzzled you.   | Talk",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Thanks for the snack... 

...I like to chip in sometimes with a helpful comment, but please don't take that as meaning that I totally agree with your recent stance on Wikipedia matters. Sure, there are some trigger-happy people about, and new editors should be treated with every consideration; but to me this doesn't mean we accept any self-publicity, trivia or opinionated diatribes they care to post. This is meant to be an encyclopedia, not like social media websites where they eagerly accept any & all user-generated content. So it may appear """"hostile"""" to those whose expectations are formed in using those other websites. To reduce the chances that a new user will have a bad experience, it would be better to argue for measures to let them know, before they post their contributions, that we do in fact have limits to what we accept and do demand scads of references. That, and educating new page patrollers and restricting new or clueless users from doing patrolling. Sorry, yes, limits and restrictions, and not because we're loveless police but because restrictions and limits are necessary to maintain our project as a usable, credible and valuable resource for the world's readers. For my money this """"inclusionist/deletionist"""" polarity is just daft. Thanks for your work and hope to see you around  (talk),  """,0,0,0,0,0,0
