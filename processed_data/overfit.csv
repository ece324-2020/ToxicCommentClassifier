 Disscussions with DMacks 

oth have understanding difficulty's.OneMadScientist (talk) 
I am talking about your behavior...we are all responsible for what we ourselves do, even if we feel provoked by others. It's a great test of one's strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations. Your edits were explicitly written to insult a person rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions, and you even said you were trying to undo your previous steps towards repairing the destructive atmosphere here. That's all forbidden. Period. No """"but he said..."""" or """"I'm just proving I was right all along"""". What are your personal intents for being a Wikipedia editor? If it's to improve wikipedia articles, then go do so now and stop wasting everyone's time with discussions about your previous battles. If it is anything else, including trying to school others in morality or your sense of religious obligation, no...this website it not for you. DMacks (talk) 

@DMacks WELL - I'am talking about your, and Plasmic Physics's behavior and responsibility around here and maybe this website it not for you.
You Would Do well Take your own advice DMacks. Is there not a word for describing the lack of following one's own advice (rules) which I have been condemned for using. Oh, yes now I remember, It is (hypocrite).
And I was Beginning to think you had realized YOUR errors in regards to YOUR application of YOUR """"Obligations"""" as a Wikipedia """"morality code"""" enforcer and understood my very significant and valid arguments.
Specifically for now -
In regards to YOUR choice!!(and the actual definition) of what exactly constitutes a personal attack around here. And the objectivity by which it is applied and the selective abuse of its application by YOU in particular.
You are now bringing up the very important point that I would Have Very Much desired to take up with you in your absence.
I am sorry, I mistook your silence for understanding on your behalf.
I contend that you have failed miserably in the """"great test of one's strength to recognize when to help raise the level of discussion rather than inflaming tense situations"""" and should have known better given your display of """"apparent"""" authority.
I contend that (In This issue with Plasmic Physics - which you had been following from the start, at least) that after my initial """"transgressions"""" and subsequent overly profuse apologies, was being very polite and civil.
I was then was the subject of an Obvious personal attack from Plasmic Physics, who was my initial accuser!! in the very first instance (again NOT taking ones own advice!!).
His remarks which OBVIOUSLY """"were explicitly written to insult a person (me) rather than as constructive criticism of specific actions"""" and contained no factual justification.
My response contained words and statements that were correctly and appropriately describing (with civil English words) the FACTS in relation to nature of his personal attacks on me.
In my attempt to obtain an apology from him, while Lacking any support against his attack, you decided to label me the transgressor, but not him.
You appear to be very negligent and biased acting in your """"appointed role here???"""" to say the least, if not totally malicious.
I contend that your obviously biased behavior should preclude you from further involvement in any """"moral code violation"""" disciplinary action, let alone this specific one.
This is for starters in addressing your negative comments about me.
I hope I have I made this point clear to YOU now!  
OneMadScientist (talk) 
I would appreciate and DESERVE an apology from both of you but I can see that is unlikely. If not Please don't waste my time any longer with YOUR """"attempts"""" at trying justify either your or Plasma Physics transgressions toward me or bother me any longer about this issue and I SHALL LEAVE YOU ALONE and seek others here who deserve my considerate attention. It appears that you two obviously should get along well together!.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 My Two Cents 

 Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. 

 Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made """"those people"""" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes!

And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct.

 Niggardly 
It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the """"controversial"""" word """"niggardly"""", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination.

What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some """"idiots"""" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!""",1,0,0,0,1,0

I was quite disappointed to have the changes I worked on earlier tonight stripped out and the page locked.  I wanted to include the current distress of ACORN and felt I was being careful in connecting relevant news agencies that would validate the issues.  Maybe my wording was less than ideal, but the content I wanted to convey certainly should be attributed to the current and apparently ongoing actions of ACORN.  Please reconsider and possible include the context of the issue more completely.  Thanks",0,0,0,0,0,0

But I'm not. Its exactly the kind of spineless response I anticipated from you. Look Schumin, I don't care about you remotely. I'm not here to bring you some sort of pain, I don't care anything, at all about you. What I do care about, and care about deeply is that the number one-stop shop for knowledge on the internet is even fractionally run by someone like you. This is a serious project, and attitudes like yours aren't needed. You are one of these people who wouldn't last a day on a serious academic venture, but sleazed your way onto Wikipedia and whored yourself as an admin. For you, being an admin is not the gruelling work it should be, its a status symbol. And thats sad. Thats really sad.
